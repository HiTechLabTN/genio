## Purpose

VODER is a professional‑grade voice processing tool that enables seamless conversion between speech, text, and music. For AI agents operating in automated pipelines, VODER offers:

- **Unified Audio Pipeline**: Eight processing modes in a single interface
- **CLI‑First Design**: All core features accessible via command line
- **No GUI Required**: Runs entirely in headless terminals
- **Full Dialogue Support**: Multi‑speaker script generation **now available in CLI** (both interactive and one‑liner)
- **Script Directives**: Per-line control over timing, volume, and duration
- **SFX Integration**: Embed sound effects directly in dialogue scripts
- **Optional Background Music for Dialogue**: Automatically generated, duration‑fitted ambient music with configurable volume levels and optional reference audio for style guidance
- **Music Generation**: Lyrics‑to‑music synthesis with voice conversion
- **Sound Effects Generation**: Text-to-audio synthesis for custom sound design
- **Sound Enhancement**: Denoise, dereverberate, and restore speech audio; voice isolation and super-resolution via AudioSR (basic + speech models)
- **Voice Cloning**: Extract and replicate voice characteristics from reference audio
- **Standalone STT**: Transcribe audio, video, images, and platform URLs to text
- **Speaker Diarization**: Identify and label individual speakers in multi‑speaker audio
- **Image OCR**: Extract text from images as dialogue input for TTS processing
- **URL Download**: Process audio from URLs on YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and X/Twitter directly (two-step verification: URL shape check + yt-dlp video verification)
- **Automatic Voice Extraction**: Extract individual voice clips from multi‑speaker sources for cloning
- **Result Routing**: Copy results to any filesystem path using the `result` parameter
- **Song Voice Separation (SVS)**: Separate vocals from music using BS‑RoFormer
- **Speaker Language Conversion (SLC)**: Translate speech to English while preserving speaker voice (TTS sub‑task: `tts slc`, `tts slc music` for music preservation)
- **Speaker Voice Change (SVC)**: Transcribe single-speaker audio and re-synthesize with a different voice (TTS sub-task: `tts svc "path" target "voice_ref"`)
- **Speakers Separator (SS)**: Extract individual speakers from multi‑speaker audio, with optional `blend` to preserve non‑vocals and `video` for video output
- **Translation in STT**: Translate transcribed speech to English automatically
- **Overdose Quality Mode**: Enhanced transcription, dialogue source analysis, and music generation using VibeVoice ASR
- **Extreme TTS Mode**: Higher quality voice cloning and broader language support using Fish Audio S2-Pro (80+ languages, voice effects via `[tag]` syntax including 64 S1 Pro tags)
- **Extreme STS Mode**: Pre-process target voice reference through Fish S2 Pro for cleaner Seed-VC conversion — extracts dominant voice from mixed/noisy references
- **Video I/O**: Video input with automatic audio extraction; video output with replaced audio (STS, SS with `video` flag, SE with `video` flag, SVS with `video` flag, TTS dub with `video` flag, TTM complete/bgm with `video` flag)
- **Side-Quests (`quest`)**: Lightweight utility tasks, grouped by category in the `quest` listing (run `quest` with no args to see the live tree). `download` (URL → audio/video file in `results/`) stands alone at the top; the other 17 quests live under the **Media Manipulation** category, split into three sub-categories — **Sound Effects** (bassboost, fade, loudnorm, pitch, reverb, soundlevel, speed), **Audio Editing** (cut, merge, mix, remove, reverse, silence), and **Format & File** (compress, convert, glue, noframes). Categorization is defined externally in `src/voders/quests_categories.py`. New quests can be added to the registry over time.
- **Chains (`chains`)**: User-defined pipelines that wire any number of voder oneline tasks together. Each chain is named, its output is captured to `temp_chains/`, and later chains can reference earlier chain names as input paths. The last non-empty chain's output reaches `results/`. Empty chains are skipped (names remain reusable); duplicate names are an error.

## Quick Start for AI Agents

AI agents typically cannot maintain interactive terminal sessions. Use the following pattern:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HAKORADev/VODER.git && cd VODER

# Install dependencies (one‑liner)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# IMPORTANT: Upgrade protobuf to avoid compatibility issues
pip install --upgrade protobuf==5.29.6

# Process files immediately (one‑liner)
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" voice "male voice"

# Transcribe audio to text (STT)
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" timestamp dialogue result "/output/transcript.txt"

# Enhance audio (SE)
python src/voder.py se "noisy_audio.wav" result "/output/enhanced.wav"

# Generate sound effects (SFX)
python src/voder.py sfx sound "thunder rumbling" duration 10 result "/output/thunder.wav"

# Separate vocals from music (SVS)
python src/voder.py svs "song.mp3" voice result "/output/vocals.wav"

# Translate speech to English (SLC via TTS)
python src/voder.py tts slc "spanish_audio.wav" result "/output/english.wav"

# Re-synthesize speech with a different voice (SVC via TTS)
python src/voder.py tts svc "speech.wav" target "voice_ref.wav" result "/output/new_voice.wav"

# Separate speakers (SS)
python src/voder.py ss "meeting.wav"

# STT with translation
python src/voder.py stt "french_audio.wav" translate timestamp result "/output/translated.txt"

# Chain multiple operations
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello" voice "female" && python src/voder.py tts script "World" voice "male"

# Or use the `chains` feature to wire multiple voder oneline tasks together in one command
# (intermediate outputs go to temp_chains/, only the last chain's output reaches results/)
python src/voder.py chains "vocals" svs voice "song.wav" / "enhanced" se voice "vocals" / "text" stt "enhanced" timestamp

# Side-quests: quick utility tasks (URL download, video→audio extraction)
python src/voder.py quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." result "/output/track.mp3"
python src/voder.py quest noframes "video.mp4" result "/output/audio.wav"
```

**For dialogue mode** (multiple characters), use multiple values per parameter. **To add background music**, include the `music` parameter with a description:

```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Welcome to the show!" "Sarah: Glad to be here." voice "James: deep male voice, authoritative" "Sarah: bright female voice, energetic" music "soft piano, cinematic"
```

**With SFX lines embedded:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "sfx: door bell /duration:3" "Sarah: Hi there!" voice "James: male" "Sarah: female" music "ambient" level "0:30-60:50"
```

## Installation

### Python Dependencies

Install all required packages in a single command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**IMPORTANT: After installing requirements, upgrade protobuf to avoid compatibility issues:**

```bash
pip install --upgrade protobuf==5.29.6
```

**Package explanations:**

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `torch` | Deep learning framework for neural network models |
| `torchaudio` | Audio loading and processing |
| `transformers` | HuggingFace model integration |
| `PyQt5` | GUI framework (required only for GUI mode) |
| `omegaconf` | Configuration management |
| `hydra-core` | Configuration framework |
| `huggingface_hub` | Model download and caching |
| `soundfile` | Audio file I/O operations |
| `yt-dlp` | Video/audio download from YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter |
| `easyocr` | Image text extraction (OCR) for processing images as dialogue input |
| `lightning` | PyTorch Lightning backend required by pyannote for speaker diarization |
| `sox` | Audio processing utilities (resampling, format conversion, channel manipulation) |
| `einx` | Required for UniSE speech enhancement model |
| `x-transformers` | Required for UniSE speech enhancement model |
| `safetensors` | Required for TangoFlux and UniSE model loading |
| `soxr` | High-quality audio resampling |
| `tqdm` | Progress bars |
| `packaging` | Version handling |
| `rotary_embedding_torch` | Rotary embeddings for BS-RoFormer SVS model |

| `ml_collections` | Configuration collections for BS-RoFormer |
| `audiosr` | Audio super‑resolution model for SE `sr` sub‑modes (install separately: `pip install audiosr`) |

**Note:** `pyannote.audio` is bundled locally in `src/libs/pyannote` and does not require a separate pip install. However, a HuggingFace token is required for speaker diarization (see [HF_TOKEN Setup for AI Agents](#hf_token-setup-for-ai-agents)).

**Note:** The `audiosr` package is optional and only needed for SE `sr` sub‑modes (`se sr`, `se sr music`, `se sr music blend`, `se sr voice`, `se sr voice blend`, `se sr voice music`). Install it separately with `pip install audiosr`. The AudioSR model is downloaded automatically on first use (~4‑6GB).

### Verify Installation

```bash
python -c "import torch; import torchaudio; print('PyTorch:', torch.__version__); print('CUDA available:', torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

---

## FFmpeg Setup

**⚠️ CRITICAL: FFmpeg is REQUIRED for audio processing and video input support.**

FFmpeg handles audio concatenation, resampling, and video audio extraction. Without FFmpeg in your system PATH, audio processing may fail or produce degraded results.

### Install FFmpeg

**Windows (winget):**
```powershell
winget install FFmpeg
```

**Windows (manual):**
```powershell
# Download from https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
# Extract to C:\ffmpeg
# Add C:\ffmpeg\bin to system PATH
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\ffmpeg\bin" /M
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

**Linux (apt):**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

### Verify FFmpeg Installation

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

### Automated FFmpeg Download (Linux/macOS)

```bash
# Download and install FFmpeg if not present
if ! command -v ffmpeg &> /dev/null; then
    cd /tmp
    wget https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.tar.xz
    tar -xf ffmpeg-release-essentials.tar.xz
    sudo cp ffmpeg-*/*/bin/ffmpeg /usr/local/bin/
    sudo cp ffmpeg-*/*/bin/ffprobe /usr/local/bin/
    rm -rf ffmpeg-*
fi
```

## HF_TOKEN Setup for AI Agents

**⚠️ REQUIRED for speaker diarization in STT mode.**

The pyannote speaker diarization model is gated on HuggingFace and requires authentication. Without a valid token, the `dialogue` flag in STT mode will fail.

### Step 1: Accept Model Conditions

Visit the following HuggingFace model pages and accept the user agreement for each:

1. **Speaker Diarization**: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1
2. **Segmentation**: https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0

You must be logged into a HuggingFace account and click "Accept" on each model's page.

### Step 2: Create the Token File

```bash
# Create HF_TOKEN.txt in the VODER root directory
echo "hf_your_token_here" > HF_TOKEN.txt
```

The token is read automatically from `HF_TOKEN.txt` when diarization is requested.

### Environment Variable Fallback

If `HF_TOKEN.txt` does not exist, VODER checks for the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable:

```bash
export HF_TOKEN="hf_your_token_here"
python src/voder.py stt "meeting.wav" dialogue
```

### Verify Token

```bash
# Test that the token is valid
python -c "from huggingface_hub import HfFolder; print('Token set:', bool(HfFolder.get_token()))"
```

---

## One‑Liner Command Patterns

AI agents can chain commands using `&&` or `;` in shell environments.

### Basic One‑Liner Pattern

```bash
python src/voder.py <mode> param "value" param "value"
```

### Dialogue Mode with Optional Background Music (One‑Liner)

Dialogue is supported in **TTS** mode using multiple values per parameter. **Background music is optional** and only available in dialogue mode (not single mode).

- For **TTS** with generated voices: supply one or more `script` lines, one or more `voice` lines (in the same character order), and optionally one `music` parameter and one `level` parameter.
- For **TTS** with cloned voices: supply one or more `script` lines, one or more `target` file paths (in the same character order), and optionally one `music` parameter and one `level` parameter.

```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello, I'm James." "Sarah: Hi James, I'm Sarah." voice "James: deep male voice, calm" "Sarah: young female voice, cheerful" music "ambient electronic, chill"

python src/voder.py tts script "James: Let's start the meeting." "Sarah: I've prepared the slides." target "James: /path/to/james.wav" "Sarah: /path/to/sarah.wav" music "soft piano, strings" level "40"
```

**With SFX lines embedded:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Narrator: Once upon a time" "sfx: magical chime /duration:5 /level:50" "Narrator: In a faraway land..." voice "Narrator: deep storytelling voice" music "fantasy orchestral"
```

**What happens when `music` is supplied:**
- VODER synthesises all dialogue segments and concatenates them.
- It then measures the exact duration of the combined dialogue.
- A music track is generated using ACE‑Step with:
  - Lyrics: `"..."` (empty placeholder)
  - Style: the value of the `music` parameter
  - Duration: exactly the dialogue length
- The music is mixed at **configurable volume** (default 35%, adjustable via `level` parameter).
- The final file is saved with an `_m` suffix (e.g., `voder_tts_dialogue_..._m.wav`).
- If `music` is omitted or set to an empty string (`music ""`), no background music is added.

### Command Chaining Examples

**Multiple TTS operations:**

```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Part one" voice "male" && python src/voder.py tts script "Part two" voice "female"
```

**Voice conversion pipeline:**

```bash
python src/voder.py sts base "input.wav" target "voice1.wav" && python src/voder.py sts base "output.wav" target "voice2.wav"
```

**Music generation with batch processing:**

```bash
python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "Verse 1:..." styling "pop" duration 30 && python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "Chorus:..." styling "rock" duration 30
```

**Sound enhancement pipeline:**

```bash
python src/voder.py se "noisy_recording.wav" result "/clean/recording.wav"
```

**Sound effects generation:**

```bash
python src/voder.py sfx sound "rain on tin roof" duration 15 result "/sfx/rain.wav"
```

### Interactive Mode (Also Supports Dialogue & Background Music)

Interactive CLI mode (`python src/voder.py cli`) presents a menu of 8 options (1‑8). In TTS mode, it allows you to enter multiple lines of script (empty line to finish) and automatically detects single vs. dialogue mode. It then prompts you for voice prompts or audio file paths (for voice cloning) for each character. When you provide audio, video, or a URL as input instead of text, the interactive flow offers a "modify speech? (Y/N)" prompt — if accepted, it runs SVS voice isolation → Whisper transcription → editable text → voice choice (source or custom) → Qwen‑TTS synthesis. **After** all prompts are collected, you will be asked:

```
Add background music? (y/N):
```

If you answer `y` or `yes`, you can enter a music description. Leaving the description blank or pressing Enter without input skips the music. This mode is **not recommended for fully automated bots**, but can be used in semi‑automated workflows.

## Command Reference

### Syntax

```bash
python src/voder.py <mode> [parameters]
```

### Mode Options

The 8 main processing modes (the engine's primary audio transformation pipelines):

| Mode | Description | GPU Required | One‑Liner |
|------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| `tts` | Text‑to‑Speech with Voice Design & Voice Cloning (via `target`), SLC sub‑task (`tts slc`), SVC sub‑task (`tts svc`), Dub sub‑task (`tts dub`), optional `overdose` for VibeVoice ASR and enhanced music | No | ✅ Yes (single & dialogue + optional music + SFX + overdose + SLC + SVC + Dub support) |
| `tts+vc` | Text‑to‑Speech + Voice Cloning — **REMOVED** (use `tts` with `target`) | No | ❌ No longer accepted |
| `sts` | Speech‑to‑Speech (Voice Conversion) with video I/O, auto vocal extraction & optional `extreme` flag | No | ✅ Yes (single only) |
| `ttm` | Text‑to‑Music Generation with sub‑tasks (`complete`, `lego`, `extract`, `remix`, `repaint`, `bgm`), `vc` flag, SFX overlay (`bgm`/`complete`), three‑tier ACE‑Step | No | ✅ Yes (single only) |
| `ttm+vc` | Text‑to‑Music + Voice Conversion — **REMOVED** (use `ttm vc` with `clone`) | No | ❌ No longer accepted |
| `stt` | Speech‑to‑Text Transcription with translation, overdose, video/URL input | No | ✅ Yes (single, batch, timestamps, diarization, URLs) |
| `se` | Sound Enhancement (Denoise/Dereverb/Super‑Resolution/Voice+Music) | No | ✅ Yes |
| `sfx` | Sound Effects Generation | No | ✅ Yes |
| `svs` | Song Voice Separation (BS‑RoFormer) | No | ✅ Yes |
| `ss` | Speakers Separator (Multi‑Speaker Extraction + optional `blend` for non‑vocals preservation) | No | ✅ Yes |

The 3 task-layer features:

| Feature | Description | GPU Required | One‑Liner |
|---------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| `train` | Voice Training — train voice clones from reference audio and save them as `.tts` / `.ttse` files for reuse in TTS | No | ✅ Yes (`train voice:name "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav"`) |
| `quest` | Side-Quests — lightweight utility tasks: URL `download` (standalone fetch) plus the Media Manipulation category (Sound Effects / Audio Editing / Format & File sub-categories — 17 quests total). Run `quest` with no args for the live grouped tree. New quests can be added to the registry over time. | No | ✅ Yes |
| `chains` | User-Defined Pipelines — wire any number of voder oneline tasks together. Each chain is named, its output is captured to `temp_chains/`, and later chains can reference earlier chain names as input paths. The last non-empty chain's output reaches `results/`. | No | ✅ Yes |

### Side-Quests (`quest`)

> **Note:** `quest` performs small utility tasks (URL download, audio format conversion, cutting, merging, audio effects, etc.) that produce files for the main modes to consume.

Side-quests are lightweight utility tasks that live outside the voder engine. They are designed to grow over time as more quests are added; each quest is a small class registered in a `SIDE_QUESTS` registry, so adding new quests does not require touching the dispatcher.

**Available quests:**

| Quest | Syntax | Description | Output |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `download` | `quest download [video] "<url>"` | Download a URL as audio (default) or video (`video` keyword). Also accepts local file paths (copies them). | `voder_quest_download_<name>_<timestamp>.<ext>` in `results/` |
| `noframes` | `quest noframes "<local_video>"` | Extract audio from a LOCAL video file. Refuses URLs and audio-only files. | `voder_quest_noframes_<name>_<timestamp>.wav` in `results/` |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Download a YouTube URL as audio (default, MP3)
python src/voder.py quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Download the same URL as video (MP4)
python src/voder.py quest download video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Extract audio from a local video file
python src/voder.py quest noframes "video.mp4"

# With result path
python src/voder.py quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." result "./out.mp3"
python src/voder.py quest noframes "video.mp4" result "./out.wav"
```

**Why side-quests exist:** Some tasks (URL fetching, video-to-audio extraction) are useful in a voder workflow but don't belong inside the engine itself. Side-quests give them a clean home and they can be combined with `chains` to form larger pipelines.

### Chains (`chains`)

> **Note:** `chains` composes the main voder oneline tasks (TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SS) and the other features (`train`, `quest`) into user-defined pipelines whose intermediate outputs are kept in `temp_chains/`.

Chains let the user compose their own pipelines out of voder's existing oneline tasks. Each chain is named, runs a voder oneline command, and its output is captured to a temp directory. Later chains can reference earlier chain names as input paths — voder substitutes the chain name with the captured temp file path before running the later chain. The **last** non-empty chain's output is exported to `results/`; intermediate outputs live in `temp_chains/`.

**Syntax:**

```
python src/voder.py chains "name1" <voder command...> / "name2" <voder command that references "name1"> / ... [result "<path>"]
```

- ` / ` (space, slash, space) separates chains.
- Each chain starts with a name (quotes optional — shell strips them).
- The rest of the chain's args are a normal voder oneline command.
- The optional trailing `result "<path>"` copies the final chain's output to a custom path.

**Validation rules:**

- **Duplicate chain names** (two non-empty chains with the same name) are an error and stop the pipeline.
- **Empty chains** (a name with no command following it) are **skipped**. Their names are NOT marked as used, so the same name can be reused later in the same `chains` command.
- **Trailing empty chains** are ignored.
- If **all** chains are empty, the pipeline returns an error.

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate a song → isolate vocals → voice-convert them
python src/voder.py chains "song" ttm lyrics "la la la" styling "pop" 30 / "voice" svs voice "song" / "cover" sts base "voice" target "ref.wav"

# Isolate vocals → enhance → transcribe
python src/voder.py chains "vocals" svs voice "song.wav" / "enhanced" se voice "vocals" / "text" stt "enhanced" timestamp

# Train a voice from a chain's output, then use it to speak
python src/voder.py chains "vocal" svs voice "song.wav" / "trained" train voice:singer "vocal" / "spoken" tts script "Hello world" voice "singer"

# Download audio → transcribe it (chaining a side-quest into a voder task)
python src/voder.py chains "audio" quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." / "text" stt "audio" timestamp

# Empty chains are skipped (names remain reusable) — this is valid:
python src/voder.py chains "skip1" / "skip2" / "real" tts script "hi" voice "male"
```

**Notes:**

- Chain names are matched exactly (case-sensitive) against command arguments. If a chain name happens to look like a file path or URL, it still wins — voder checks chain names first.
- For multi-output commands (e.g., `svs both`, `ss`, TTM with stems), only the **latest** file produced by the chain is exposed as the chain's output. If you need multiple outputs, run separate chains.
- The `train` command works inside chains: its `.tts` / `.ttse` file is the chain's output and is stored in `temp_chains/` for intermediate chains.


### Text‑to‑Speech (tts)

Generate speech from text using Qwen3‑TTS VoiceDesign model.
**Supports both single and dialogue modes. Dialogue mode supports optional background music and SFX lines.**
**Voice cloning is available via the `target` parameter — supply a voice reference audio path to clone that voice. Multi-reference cloning is supported using parenthesized format: `(path1)(path2)(path3)`. Add the `first` keyword before the references (`target first "(path1)(path2)(path3)"`) to extract only the first reference's speaker from all others via TSE before compiling.**
**SLC (Speaker Language Conversion) is available as a sub‑task: `tts slc "path.wav"`, `tts slc music "path.wav"`, `tts overdose slc "path.wav"`, `tts overdose slc music "path.wav"`. Always translates to English using Whisper large-v3. Supports audio files, video files, and URLs from any supported platform (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter) with automatic SVS voice isolation on source. The `music` flag preserves non-vocals by extracting and blending the instrumental track.**
**SVC (Speaker Voice Change) is available as a sub‑task: `tts svc "path.wav" target "voice_ref.wav"`. Transcribes single-speaker audio and re-synthesizes it with a different target voice. The pipeline runs SVS voice isolation → Whisper/VibeVoice transcription → Qwen‑TTS synthesis with the specified target voice. Add the `overdose` flag to use VibeVoice ASR instead of Whisper. Supports the `sts:` prefix on `target` to route through STS v2 (Seed‑VC) for voice conversion instead of Qwen‑TTS, preserving more of the original prosody.**
**Dub (Video/Audio Dubbing) is available as a sub‑task: `tts dub "video.mp4"`. Dubs video/audio with voice cloning, translation, optional subtitle burning, and speed adjustment. Auto‑implies `overdose` and `extreme`. Supports `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` for language override, `subtitle` (transcribes dubbed audio for accurate subtitles) / `subtitle original` (subtitles from original audio chain) / `subtitle (source-target)` / `subtitle (target)` for subtitle burning (independent translation), and `se` for sound enhancement.**

**In interactive CLI mode, providing audio/video/URL as input triggers a "modify speech? (Y/N)" prompt that runs the STT+TTS flow: SVS voice isolation → Whisper transcription → edit text → choose voice (source or custom) → Qwen‑TTS synthesis.**

**Single mode (voice design):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "text here" voice "voice description"
```

**Single mode (voice cloning via target):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "text here" target "voice_reference.wav"
```

**Single mode (multi-reference cloning):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "text here" target "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```

**Single mode (multi-reference cloning with `first` — extract only first reference's speaker from all others):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "text here" target first "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```

**Single mode with language parameter:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Hola mundo" voice "female, warm" language "Spanish"
```

**OCR input (image to narration):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts ocr "path/to/image.png" voice "text: professional male narrator"

python src/voder.py tts ocr "script_screenshot.jpg" voice "text: warm female voice"
```

**Dialogue mode (no music):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" voice "Character1: voice prompt for char1" "Character2: voice prompt for char2"
```

**Dialogue mode with background music:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" voice "Character1: voice prompt for char1" "Character2: voice prompt for char2" music "description of background music"

# With reference audio for style guidance
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" voice "Character1: voice prompt for char1" "Character2: voice prompt for char2" music "description of background music" reference "path/to/style_ref.wav"

# With video file as reference for style guidance
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" voice "Character1: voice prompt for char1" "Character2: voice prompt for char2" music "description of background music" reference "path/to/style_ref.mp4"

# With YouTube URL as reference for style guidance
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" voice "Character1: voice prompt for char1" "Character2: voice prompt for char2" music "description of background music" reference "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
```

**Dialogue mode with music volume control:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" voice "Character1: voice prompt" "Character2: voice prompt" music "soft piano" level "0:30-60:50"
```

**Dialogue with trained voices:**
```bash
# Use a trained voice by name (latest .tts from voices/ directory)
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" voice "my-character"

# Use a specific trained .tts file
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" voice "my-character:path/to/file.tts"

# Use a trained voice for a different character name
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" voice "my-char:another-name"

# Dialogue with trained voices
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" script "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: hero" voice "Sarah: heroine"

# Mix trained and described voices
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" script "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: hero" voice "Sarah: cheerful female"
```

**Newline support in scripts:**
```bash
# Use \n for line breaks in script text
python src/voder.py tts script "James: First line\nSecond line" voice "James: deep male"

# Newline in dialogue
python src/voder.py tts script "Narrator: Chapter one\nThe beginning" voice "Narrator: deep male"
```

**Dialogue with SFX lines:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "sfx: door bell /duration:3 /level:60" "Sarah: Hi!" voice "James: male" "Sarah: female" music "ambient"
```

**TTS with overdose mode:**
```bash
# Overdose mode: uses VibeVoice ASR for dialogue source analysis and voice clip extraction (when using audio as dialogue source)
python src/voder.py tts overdose script "James: Hello" script "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: deep male" voice "Sarah: cheerful female"

# Overdose mode with voice cloning and background music (music uses ACE-Step XL turbo)
python src/voder.py tts overdose script "James: Hello" script "Sarah: Hi" target "James: james.wav" target "Sarah: sarah.wav" music "soft piano"
```

When `overdose` is used:
- Dialogue source analysis uses **VibeVoice ASR** instead of Whisper + pyannote for higher accuracy transcription and speaker identification
- Voice clip extraction from multi-speaker audio uses VibeVoice ASR segments with automatic overlap trimming (removes first 2s and last 3s from longest segment to avoid cross-speaker overlap)
- Background music generation uses **ACE-Step XL turbo** for enhanced quality
- Requires 24GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ combined system memory for VibeVoice ASR

**TTS with extreme mode:**
```bash
# Extreme mode: uses Fish Audio S2-Pro for higher quality TTS
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "Hello world" target "voice.wav"

# Extreme + voice effects
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "[whispering] Hello there [pause] how are you?" target "voice.wav"

# Extreme + overdose combined
python src/voder.py tts overdose extreme script "James: Hello" target "James: james.wav" music "soft piano"

# Extreme with voice design (placeholder trick for all languages)
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "Arabic text here" voice "deep male"

# Extreme with trained .ttse voice
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "Hello" voice "my-character"
```

When `extreme` is used:
- TTS synthesis uses **Fish Audio S2-Pro** instead of Qwen3-TTS for higher quality voice cloning
- Supports 80+ languages (vs 10 for Qwen3-TTS), enabling voice design for Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Turkish, and many more
- Voice effects via `[tag]` syntax in script text: S2-Pro well-tested tags cover emotions (`[excited]`, `[angry]`, `[sad]`), tones (`[whispering]`, `[soft voice]`, `[low voice]`, `[loud voice]`, `[shouting]`), breathing (`[sigh]`, `[inhale]`, `[exhale]`, `[gasp]`, `[panting]`, `[clears throat]`), vocal sounds (`[laughing]`, `[chuckling]`, `[giggle]`, `[sobbing]`, `[crying]`, `[groan]`), pacing (`[pause]`, `[short pause]`, `[long pause]`), special (`[emphasis]`, `[rustling sound]`). 64 S1 Pro tags also work in `[brackets]` (e.g., `(furious)`, `(sarcastic)`, `(screaming)`, `(audience laughing)`), plus 15,000+ free-form descriptions like `[professional broadcast tone]`, `[pitch up]`, `[voice rough from crying, trying to sound normal]`. Multi-language tags also work (e.g., `[低声说]` for Chinese). Tags affect text from their position onward
- Voice design always uses placeholder trick: generates English placeholder via VoiceDesign → Fish clones it → Fish speaks actual text. This applies unconditionally to ensure consistent voice quality and preserve voice effects tags across all languages
- Can be combined with `overdose` (they affect different pipeline stages)
- Trained voices use `.ttse` files; using `.tts` with extreme or `.ttse` without extreme produces an error

**SLC (Speaker Language Conversion) — TTS Sub‑task:**

Translate speech from any language to English while preserving the speaker's voice. SLC is now a TTS sub‑task accessed via `tts slc`. Always translates to English using Whisper large-v3 (not turbo). Supports audio files, video files, and URLs from any supported platform. SVS voice isolation runs automatically on the source before processing.

**Translate to English:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts slc "spanish_speech.wav"
```

**Translate with music preservation (blend non-vocals back):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts slc music "speech.wav" result "/output.wav"
```

**Translate with overdose quality:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts overdose slc "speech.wav" result "/output.wav"
```

**Overdose + music preservation:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts overdose slc music "speech.wav" result "/output.wav"
```

**Extreme SLC (Fish S2-Pro for resynthesis):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts extreme slc "speech.wav" result "/output.wav"
```

**Overdose + extreme SLC:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts overdose extreme slc "speech.wav" result "/output.wav"
```

**From YouTube/Video URL:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts slc "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." result "/output/english.wav"
```

**SLC Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `slc` | Invoke SLC sub‑task within TTS mode (always translates to English) | Yes (for SLC) |
| `music` | Preserve non-vocals — extract instrumental and blend with voice output | No |
| `file` | Input audio/video/URL (positional after `slc` or `slc music`) | Yes |
| `result` | Output path | No |

**SLC Limitations:**
- Translation quality depends on Whisper large-v3's transcription accuracy for the source language
- Output is always English (Whisper can only translate to English)
- Voice-music sync may vary when using the `music` flag; this is inherent to the approach

**SLC with any-to-any translation (TranslateGemma 12B):**

Use `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` to translate to any of 76 supported languages instead of only English:

```bash
# Translate to Arabic, preserving original voice
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(auto-ar)" "spanish_speech.wav"

# Translate to Arabic with music preservation
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(auto-ar)" music "spanish_speech.wav"

# Shorthand: (ar) is equivalent to (auto-ar)
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(ar)" "spanish_speech.wav"

# Japanese to English
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(ja-en)" "japanese_speech.wav"

# English to French
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(en-fr)" "english_speech.wav"
```

> **Note:** The standalone `slc` mode has been merged into TTS. The old `slc` command is no longer accepted — use `tts slc` instead. The `translate` keyword is no longer needed; SLC always translates to English.

#### SVC (Speaker Voice Change)

Transcribe single-speaker audio and re-synthesize it with a different voice. SVC is a TTS sub‑task accessed via `tts svc`. The pipeline isolates vocals via SVS, transcribes with Whisper (or VibeVoice with `overdose`), then synthesizes new speech using Qwen‑TTS with the specified target voice. When the `sts:` prefix is used on `target`, an additional Seed‑VC v2 non‑mimic pass is applied after Qwen‑TTS synthesis for higher voice fidelity to the target reference. Multi-reference targets are supported: `target "(ref1.wav)(ref2.wav)(ref3.wav)"` concatenates multiple references for richer voice extraction.

**SVC Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `svc` | Invoke SVC sub‑task within TTS mode (positional path after `svc`) | Yes (for SVC) |
| `target` / `voice` | Voice reference for re-synthesis. Use `target "path"` for a voice clone reference or `voice "description"` for a generated voice | Yes |
| `overdose` | Use VibeVoice ASR instead of Whisper for transcription | No |

**SVC Pipeline:**
1. SVS voice isolation on source audio
2. Whisper / VibeVoice transcription of isolated vocals
3. Qwen‑TTS synthesis with the specified target voice
4. (Optional) If `target` uses `sts:` prefix → additional Seed‑VC v2 non‑mimic pass after Qwen‑TTS synthesis for enhanced voice fidelity

**Basic SVC:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts svc "speech.wav" target "voice_ref.wav" result "/output/new_voice.wav"
```

**SVC with overdose quality:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts overdose svc "speech.wav" target "voice_ref.wav" result "/output/new_voice.wav"
```

**SVC with sts: prefix (STS v2 voice conversion):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts svc "speech.wav" target "sts:voice_ref.wav" result "/output/new_voice.wav"
```

**SVC with generated voice:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts svc "speech.wav" voice "deep male voice, authoritative" result "/output/new_voice.wav"
```

**SVC with multi-reference target:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts svc "speech.wav" target "(ref1.wav)(ref2.wav)(ref3.wav)" result "/output/new_voice.wav"
```

**SVC with STS pass and multi-reference:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts svc "speech.wav" target "sts:(ref1.wav)(ref2.wav)" result "/output/new_voice.wav"
```

**Output naming:** SVC outputs are saved as `voder_tts_svc_*.wav` (or the path specified by `result`).

#### TTS Dub (Video/Audio Dubbing)

TTS Dub is a sub‑task for dubbing video or audio content with voice cloning, translation, subtitle burning, and speed adjustment. The `dub` keyword auto‑implies `overdose` and `extreme` (Fish S2 Pro), but they are recommended to include explicitly for clarity in documentation. Dub defaults to auto→English translation (no `translate` keyword needed); use `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` to override the target language. The `subtitle` keyword transcribes the dubbed audio using VibeVoice ASR and burns subtitles onto the output video — this is the final step after dubbing, ensuring subtitle timing and text accurately match what was actually spoken. Use `subtitle original` to derive subtitles from the original audio processing chain (TTS text with original timing) instead. Use `subtitle (source-target)` or `subtitle (target)` for an independent translation pass for subtitles. Add `se` before `dub` to enable optional sound enhancement before ASR. The pipeline transcribes speech with VibeVoice ASR (optionally preceded by sound enhancement), translates with TranslateGemma 12B (which loads once for all translations — both dub audio and subtitle — then unloads once), re‑synthesizes with Fish S2 Pro using per‑segment TTS generation with voice cloning from each speaker's original audio, assembles output via timeline‑based overlay (segments placed at their original positions), adjusts speed to match original timing (threshold 1.5/0.5), mixes with instrumentals, and muxes with video. Audio events are preserved for non‑speech segment detection.

**Pipeline:** Download/extract audio → SVS voice+music separation → *(optional)* Sound enhancement (`se`) → VibeVoice ASR (speaker diarization + audio event detection) → TranslateGemma translation (loads once for dub audio + subtitle original translations, then unloads once; auto→English by default, or `translate (source-target)`) → Fish S2 Pro TTS (per‑segment voice cloning from source) → timeline‑based assembly (overlay segments at original positions) → speed adjustment (threshold 1.5/0.5) → mix with instrumentals → *(if subtitle bare)* VibeVoice ASR transcribes dubbed audio → *(if subtitle (source-target))* TranslateGemma translates subtitle segments → subtitle burn + mux with video (if subtitle) or mux with video (no subtitle)

**Commands:**

```bash
# Basic dub (auto→English translation, voice cloning from source speakers)
python src/voder.py tts dub "video.mp4"

# Dub with subtitle burning (transcribes dubbed audio for accurate subtitles)
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "video.mp4"

# Dub with subtitles from original audio processing chain
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle original "video.mp4"

# Dub with translation to Arabic instead of English
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(auto-ar)" "video.mp4"

# Shorthand: (ar) is equivalent to (auto-ar)
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(ar)" "video.mp4"

# Dub with translation and subtitles (transcribes dubbed audio)
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(auto-ar)" subtitle "video.mp4"

# Dub with independently translated subtitles (English) and audio (Japanese)
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "(auto-en)" translate "(auto-ja)" "video.mp4"

# Shorthand: (en) and (ja) equivalent to (auto-en) and (auto-ja)
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "(en)" translate "(ja)" "video.mp4"

# Dub with original-chain subtitles independently translated to English
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle original "(auto-en)" translate "(auto-ja)" "video.mp4"

# Full-form canonical command (recommended for clarity — overdose/extreme auto-implied by dub)
python src/voder.py tts overdose extreme se dub subtitle "(auto-en)" translate "(auto-ja)" video "video.mp4"

# Dub with sound enhancement, translation to Arabic, and subtitles
python src/voder.py tts overdose extreme se dub translate "(auto-ar)" subtitle "video.mp4"

# Dub audio file (output is WAV)
python src/voder.py tts dub "audio.wav"

# Dub with specific source-target translation
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(ja-en)" "japanese_video.mp4"

# Dub from URL — audio downloaded by default → WAV output
python src/voder.py tts dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Dub from URL with `video` keyword — video downloaded → MP4 output with dubbed audio muxed back
python src/voder.py tts dub video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Dub from URL with `subtitle` keyword — video is downloaded automatically (subtitles require frames)
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
```

**Dub Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `dub` | Invoke dub sub‑task within TTS mode (auto‑implies `extreme`/Fish S2 Pro). Defaults to auto→English translation | Yes (for dub) |
| `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` | Override target language via TranslateGemma 12B (76 languages). Defaults to auto→English if omitted. `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` | No |
| `subtitle` | Transcribe dubbed audio with VibeVoice ASR and burn subtitles onto output video (final step after dubbing) | No |
| `subtitle original` | Burn subtitles derived from the original audio processing chain (TTS text with original timing) | No |
| `subtitle (source-target)` or `subtitle (target)` | Transcribe dubbed audio and burn independently translated subtitles onto output video (separate from dub audio language). `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` | No |
| `subtitle original (source-target)` or `subtitle original (target)` | Burn subtitles from the original audio chain with independent translation. `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` | No |
| `se` | Enable sound enhancement before ASR (optional) | No |
| `video "path"` | Specify input video path | No |
| `video` | (flag) When source is a URL, download the full video and output MP4 (default: audio download → WAV). Implicit when `subtitle` is used with a URL. | No |
| `overdose` | Auto‑implied by `dub` but can be specified for clarity | No |
| `result "path"` | Custom output path | No |

**Output formats:**
- Video file input: MP4 (dubbed audio muxed with original video)
- Audio file input: WAV
- URL input: audio downloaded by default (WAV); add the `video` keyword to download full video (MP4). When `subtitle` is used with a URL, video is downloaded automatically (subtitles require frames).

**Requirements:** 24GB+ VRAM (VibeVoice ASR and Fish S2 Pro loaded separately), FFmpeg

#### STS Voice Pass (`sts:` Prefix)

The `sts:` prefix on a `target` reference applies an additional Seed‑VC v2 non‑mimic voice conversion pass after the standard Qwen‑TTS cloning synthesis. This produces a more faithful voice match by running the TTS output through Seed‑VC v2 using the `sts:` reference as the target voice, preserving more of the target's voice characteristics while keeping the speech content intact. The `sts:` prefix works in single mode, dialogue mode, SVC sub‑task, and interactive modify speech.

**Where `sts:` works:**
- **Single TTS**: `target "sts:voice_ref.wav"` — clones via Qwen‑TTS then Seed‑VC v2 pass for enhanced fidelity
- **Dialogue TTS**: `target "Character:sts:voice_ref.wav"` — each character's lines are synthesized then converted via Seed‑VC v2
- **SVC**: `tts svc "source.wav" target "sts:voice_ref.wav"` — transcribe then apply Seed‑VC v2 pass after synthesis
- **Modify Speech**: When entering a custom voice reference, prefix with `sts:` to apply the Seed‑VC v2 pass after Qwen‑TTS synthesis

**Single mode with sts: prefix:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" target "sts:voice_ref.wav"
```

**Dialogue mode with sts: prefix:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "Sarah: Hi" target "James:sts:james_ref.wav" "Sarah:sarah_ref.wav"
```

**SVC with sts: prefix:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts svc "speech.wav" target "sts:voice_ref.wav" result "/output/new_voice.wav"
```

**Voice Stabilization:**

VoiceDesign characters in dialogue mode automatically get their voice stabilized. After 3 script lines, the outputs are concatenated, SVS-cleaned, and fed to Qwen3-TTS Base for voice extraction. All subsequent lines use the cloned voice instead of VoiceDesign, eliminating vocal drift in long dialogues. This happens automatically with no configuration needed.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `script` | Text to synthesize (single mode) OR `Character: text` (dialogue mode) OR `sfx: description /duration:nn` (SFX lines) | Yes |
| `voice` | Voice prompt (single mode) OR `Character: prompt` (dialogue mode) for generated voices. Also accepts trained voice names/paths: `"character-name"`, `"character-name:path/to/file.tts"`, or `"character-name:another-name"` | Yes (unless all scripts are SFX lines or using target) |
| `target` | Path to voice reference (single) OR `Character: path` (dialogue) for cloned voices — can mix with `voice`. Supports `sts:` prefix (e.g. `"sts:voice_ref.wav"`) to route through STS v2 (Seed‑VC) for voice conversion instead of Qwen‑TTS. Multi-reference format: `(path1)(path2)(path3)` concatenates multiple references into one. Add `first` keyword before the refs (`target first "(path1)(path2)"`) to extract only the first reference's speaker from all others via TSE before compiling | No (but required if no `voice` for non-SFX lines) |
| `music` | Description for automatically generated background music (dialogue only) | No |
| `level` | Music volume levels e.g. `"10:20-50 30:60-80"` (dialogue modes, default: 35%) | No |
| `reference` | Reference audio/video/URL for dialogue background music style guidance (processed via SVS music pipe to extract clean instrumental) | No |
| `overdose` | Use VibeVoice ASR for dialogue source/voice clip extraction and ACE-Step XL turbo for background music (TTS mode) | No |
| `extreme` | Use Fish Audio S2-Pro instead of Qwen3-TTS for TTS synthesis — higher quality cloning, 80+ languages, voice effects `[tag]` tags (S2-Pro + 64 S1 Pro tags). Can combine with `overdose`. Trained voices use `.ttse` files | No |
| `language` | Output language for speech synthesis (e.g., `"Spanish"`, `"English"`) | No |
| `slc` | Invoke SLC sub‑task for speech translation to English (use `tts slc "path.wav"`, `tts slc music "path.wav"` for music preservation) | No |
| `svc` | Invoke SVC sub‑task for speaker voice change (use `tts svc "path.wav" target "voice_ref.wav"`) | No |
| `dub` | Invoke Dub sub‑task for video/audio dubbing with voice cloning, translation, and optional subtitles (use `tts dub "video.mp4"`; auto‑implies `overdose` and `extreme`) | No |

**Voice Prompt Examples:**

| Voice Type | Prompt |
|------------|--------|
| Male | "adult male, deep voice, clear pronunciation" |
| Female | "adult female, soft voice, friendly tone" |
| Energetic | "young adult, excited tone, fast speech" |
| Narrator | "middle‑aged, authoritative, slow pace" |

**Music Description Examples:**

| Mood | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Cinematic | "soft piano, cinematic strings, emotional" |
| Ambient | "ambient electronic, chill, atmospheric" |
| Corporate | "corporate background, professional, subtle" |
| Fantasy | "orchestral fantasy, magical, adventurous" |

**Level Specification Examples:**

| Format | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `"35"` | Constant 35% volume throughout |
| `"50"` | Constant 50% volume throughout |
| `"0:20-60:50"` | 20% at 0 seconds, 50% at 60 seconds |
| `"0:30-30:50+10"` | Fade from 30% to 50% over 10 seconds starting at 0s |

**Cross-use Feature (Mixing Generated and Cloned Voices):**

TTS one-line mode supports mixing generated and cloned voices in the same dialogue. Use `voice "Character: prompt"` for generated voices and `target "Character: path"` for cloned voices:

```bash
# TTS mode with mixed voices: James uses generated, Sarah uses cloned
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello!" "Sarah: Hi there!" voice "James: deep male voice" target "Sarah: /path/to/sarah_voice.wav"

# TTS mode with mixed voices: James uses cloned, Sarah uses generated
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Welcome!" "Sarah: Thanks!" target "James: /path/to/james_voice.wav" voice "Sarah: bright female voice"

# TTS mode with multi-reference cloning per character
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello!" target "James:(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"

# TTS mode with multi-reference cloning + first keyword (extract only first ref's speaker from all others)
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello!" target first "James:(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```

**Important:** A character cannot have both `voice` and `target` assignments — each character must use either generated or cloned voice, not both.

> **Note:** The `tts+vc` mode has been fully merged into TTS. The old `tts+vc` command is no longer accepted — use `tts` with `target` instead.

### Voice Training (train voice / train extreme voice)

> **Note:** `train` saves a voice clone as a `.tts` (standard Qwen3-TTS) or `.ttse` (extreme Fish S2-Pro) file in `voices/` for later reuse in TTS via the `voice "<name>"` parameter.

Train a voice clone from reference audio and save it for later reuse. Oneline-only command. Use `train voice` for Qwen3-TTS (`.tts` files) or `train extreme voice` for Fish S2-Pro (`.ttse` files).

```bash
# Train a voice from a single reference (standard Qwen3-TTS)
python src/voder.py train voice:character-name "path/to/reference.wav"

# Train from multiple references (SVS-cleaned and concatenated)
python src/voder.py train voice:character-name "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav" "ref3.wav"

# Train with first keyword (extract only first ref's speaker from all others via TSE)
python src/voder.py train voice:character-name first "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav" "ref3.wav"

# Train with test sample (hardcoded 30+ second script)
python src/voder.py train voice:character-name "ref.wav" test

# Train with custom test script
python src/voder.py train voice:character-name "ref.wav" test "Custom test script text"

# Train extreme voice (Fish S2-Pro, saves .ttse)
python src/voder.py train extreme voice:character-name "path/to/reference.wav"

# Train extreme from multiple references
python src/voder.py train extreme voice:character-name "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav"

# Train extreme with test sample
python src/voder.py train extreme voice:character-name "ref.wav" test
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `voice:name` | Character name for the trained voice (used to reference it later) | Yes |
| `extreme` | Use Fish S2-Pro instead of Qwen3-TTS; saves `.ttse` instead of `.tts` | No |
| `"path1" "path2" ...` | One or more audio file paths for reference audio | Yes |
| `first` | Extract only the first reference's speaker from all others via TSE before compiling (oneline only) | No |
| `test` | Generate a test sample using a hardcoded 30+ second script | No |
| `test "script"` | Generate a test sample using a custom test script | No |

**Output:** Standard trained voices are saved as `voder_tts_character-name_timestamp.tts`; extreme trained voices are saved as `voder_ttse_character-name_timestamp.ttse` — both in the `voices/` directory. `.tts` files work only without `extreme`; `.ttse` files work only with `extreme`.

**Using Trained Voices:** See the `voice` parameter in the TTS section above for syntax (`"character-name"`, `"character-name:path.tts"`, `"character-name:path.ttse"`, `"character-name:another-name"`).

### Text‑to‑Speech + Voice Clone (merged into TTS)

> **Note:** The `tts+vc` mode has been fully merged into TTS. The old command is no longer accepted. See [Text‑to‑Speech (tts)](#text-to-speech-tts) for the unified documentation.

Generate speech from text then clone it to target voice using Qwen3‑TTS Base model.  
**Supports both single and dialogue modes. Dialogue mode supports optional background music and SFX lines.**

**Single mode:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "text here" target "voice_reference.wav"
```

**OCR input (image to narration with voice clone):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts ocr "path/to/image.png" target "text: voice_reference.wav"

python src/voder.py tts ocr "subtitle_image.jpg" target "text: speaker_clone.wav"
```

**Dialogue mode (no music):**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" target "Character1: /path/to/ref1.wav" "Character2: /path/to/ref2.wav"
```

**Dialogue mode with background music:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "Character1: line1" "Character2: line2" target "Character1: /path/to/ref1.wav" "Character2: /path/to/ref2.wav" music "description of background music"
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `script` | Text to synthesize (single) OR `Character: text` (dialogue) OR `sfx: description /duration:nn` (SFX lines) | Yes |
| `target` | Path to voice reference audio (single) OR `Character: path` (dialogue) for cloned voices | Yes (unless all scripts are SFX lines or using voice) |
| `voice` | Voice prompt (single) OR `Character: prompt` (dialogue) for generated voices — can mix with `target` | No (but required if no `target` for non-SFX lines) |
| `music` | Description for automatically generated background music (dialogue only) | No |
| `level` | Music volume levels (dialogue modes, default: 35%) | No |
| `reference` | Reference audio/video/URL for dialogue background music style guidance (processed via SVS music pipe to extract clean instrumental) | No |
| `overdose` | Use VibeVoice ASR for dialogue source/voice clip extraction and ACE-Step XL turbo for background music (TTS mode) | No |
| `extreme` | Use Fish Audio S2-Pro instead of Qwen3-TTS for TTS synthesis — higher quality cloning, 80+ languages, voice effects `[tag]` tags (S2-Pro + 64 S1 Pro tags). Can combine with `overdose`. Trained voices use `.ttse` files | No |

**Voice Reference Requirements:**
- Format: WAV (recommended), MP3 supported
- Duration: 5‑30 seconds optimal
- Quality: Clear speech, minimal background noise
- Content: Single speaker, continuous speech

### Speech‑to‑Speech / Voice Conversion (sts)

Convert voice from base audio to target voice without changing content using Seed‑VC v2. **MSTS (Music-STS)**: For musical inputs, add the `music` keyword to use Seed‑VC v1 at 44.1kHz for better quality. **Supports video input/output**: when a video file is provided as `base`, audio is auto‑extracted, processed, and re‑muxed into an `.mp4` output. **Automatic vocal extraction**: vocals are automatically extracted from both the source and the `target` before voice conversion. Source music is separated and mixed back after conversion. **`nomusic` flag**: outputs converted voice only without mixing back the source music. **`original` flag**: skips SVS split on the source, processing the full original audio directly with the SVS-cleaned target — useful when the separation step introduces artifacts. **`extreme` flag**: pre-processes the target voice reference through Fish S2 Pro before Seed-VC conversion — transcribes the compiled reference with VibeVoice ASR, re-synthesizes it with Fish S2 Pro to produce a cleaner, more natural voice profile that extracts the dominant voice and removes background artifacts/noise, giving Seed-VC a cleaner input. Works with both Seed-VC v1 (music) and v2 (standard/mimic). Oneline mode only.

```bash
python src/voder.py sts base "source_audio.wav" target "voice_reference.wav"

python src/voder.py sts base "song.wav" target "voice_reference.wav" music

python src/voder.py sts base "song.wav" target "voice_reference.wav" nomusic

python src/voder.py sts original base "source_audio.wav" target "voice_reference.wav"

```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `base` | Path to source audio or video | Yes |
| `target` | Path to target voice reference audio. Multi-reference format: `(path1)(path2)(path3)` concatenates multiple references into one. Add `first` keyword before the refs (`target first "(path1)(path2)"`) to extract only the first reference's speaker from all others via TSE before compiling | Yes |
| `music` | Use Seed-VC v1 (44.1kHz) for musical inputs | No |
| `mimic` | Transfer accent and speaking style from target voice | No |
| `nomusic` | Output converted voice only (no music recombination) | No |
| `original` | Skip SVS split on source — process full original source directly with SVS-cleaned target. Useful when SVS separation introduces artifacts | No |
| `extreme` | Pre-process target reference through Fish S2 Pro before Seed-VC — transcribes with VibeVoice ASR, re-synthesizes with Fish S2 Pro for a cleaner, more natural voice profile that extracts the dominant voice from mixed/noisy references. Oneline mode only | No |

**Supported Input Formats:**
- Audio: WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG
- Video: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV (audio auto‑extracted)

**MSTS Example:**
```bash
python src/voder.py sts base "presentation.mp4" target "voice_actor.wav" music
```

**Video I/O Example:**
```bash
# From video input (auto-extracts audio, outputs .mp4 with replaced audio)
python src/voder.py sts base "presentation.mp4" target "voice_actor.wav" result "/output/output.mp4"
```

**Mimic Example (Style Transfer):**
```bash
python src/voder.py sts base "source_audio.wav" target "character_voice.wav" mimic
```

**Multi-Reference Target Example:**
```bash
python src/voder.py sts base "source.wav" target "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```

**Multi-Reference Target with `first` (extract only first ref's speaker from all others):**
```bash
python src/voder.py sts base "source.wav" target first "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```
**Note:** `mimic` and `music` cannot be used together. `nomusic` cannot be used with `music`.

### Text‑to‑Music (ttm)

Generate music from lyrics and style prompt using ACE‑Step (three‑tier architecture). Supports instrumental-only generation with empty lyrics. **Sub‑tasks**: `complete` (add missing tracks), `lego` (build individual instrument tracks), `extract` (extract specific tracks), `remix` (style transfer / cover with `bias` control and optional `lyrics`), `repaint` (restyle a specific time range; multi-pass for sequential edits building on each previous result). **SFX overlay**: `bgm` and `complete` sub‑tasks support `sfx:` specs to overlay generated sound effects onto the output. **Voice conversion**: add `vc` flag **before** `lyrics`/`styling`/`duration` and use `clone` for voice reference. **Overdose quality**: add `overdose` flag for enhanced output quality.

**Flags and modifiers** (can be combined):
- `vc` — enable voice conversion after music generation
- `overdose` — use enhanced quality (three‑tier ACE‑Step)
- `vc` and `remix` are mutually exclusive
- `vc` and `repaint` are mutually exclusive

**Generate music (standard):**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "song lyrics" styling "style description" duration 30
```

**Generate music with overdose quality:**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "song lyrics" styling "pop" duration 30 overdose
```

**Generate song then extract vocals only (voice keyword):**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm voice lyrics "song lyrics" styling "pop" duration 30
```

**Generate song with reference then extract vocals:**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm voice lyrics "song lyrics" styling "pop" duration 30 target voice "ref.wav"
```

**Generate music with voice conversion (vc flag BEFORE lyrics, use `clone` for voice ref):**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm vc lyrics "song lyrics" styling "pop" duration 30 clone "voice.wav"
```

**TTM VC with multi-reference clone:**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm vc lyrics "song lyrics" styling "pop" duration 30 clone "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```

**TTM VC with multi-reference clone + `first` (extract only first ref's speaker from all others):**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm vc lyrics "song lyrics" styling "pop" duration 30 clone first "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```

**Maximum TTM VC command (with overdose, target music ref, and result):**

python src/voder.py ttm bgm "podcast.wav" sfx "doorbell/5-12/50" result "/output/bgm_sfx_only.wav"
```

**BGM Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `bgm "source"` | Source audio/video/URL to replace music in | Yes |
| `music "description"` | Description for new background music | No (required unless `sfx:` specs provided) |
| `level <0-100>` | Music volume level (default: 35) | No |
| `sfx "prompt/duration-position/level"` | SFX overlay spec: prompt (required), duration 5-30s (auto-clamped), position in seconds (required, non-negative, cannot exceed source duration), level 1-100% (optional, default: 50). Multiple `sfx:` specs allowed. | No |
| `video` | Preserve video output (downloads video from URL, merges back to .mp4) | No |
| `reference "path"` | Reference audio/video/URL for style guidance (up to 3 entries with `voice`/`music` prefix; multiple refs composed into 30s composite) | No |
| `overdose` | Use ACE-Step XL 1.5 turbo for enhanced quality | No |

**BGM Rules:**
- Cannot be combined with `vc`, `remix`, `repaint`, `complete`, `lego`, or `extract`
- Source supports audio files, video files, and URLs
- `music` is optional if `sfx:` specs are provided; at least one of `music` or `sfx:` must be present
- When `sfx:` is provided without `music`, SFX are overlaid directly on the clean voice source
- When both `music` and `sfx:` are provided, SFX are overlaid after BGM mixing
- `video` flag: when source is a YouTube URL, downloads the video file (not just audio) and merges the result back into .mp4. For local video files, video output is automatic (no flag needed). If `video` is used with an audio source, outputs .wav with a warning.
- Reference supports audio files, video files, and URLs; up to 3 references composed into 30s composite
- Normal uses ACE-Step turbo 1.5; overdose uses ACE-Step XL 1.5 turbo
- SFX are generated by TangoFlux; ACE-Step is offloaded first to free GPU memory
- Output naming: `voder_ttm_bgm_{original-name}_{timestamp}.wav` (audio) or `.mp4` (video)

**Instrument tracks:** The 12 available tracks are: `woodwinds`, `brass`, `fx`, `synth`, `strings`, `percussion`, `keyboard`, `guitar`, `bass`, `drums`, `backing_vocals`, `vocals`. Shortcuts: `everything` = all 12 tracks, `instruments` = 10 non‑voice tracks, `voices` = `vocals` + `backing_vocals`.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `lyrics` | Song lyrics with optional structural tags in `[brackets]` (e.g. `[Verse 1]`, `[Chorus]`, `[Bridge]`, `[Intro]`, `[Outro]`, `[Interlude]`, `[Instrumental]`/`[inst]`, `[Pre-Chorus]`, `[Hook]`, `[Solo]`, `[Break]` — text inside brackets is not sung). Use `"..."` for instrumental only. Also optional for `remix` to guide new vocal content | Yes (generate mode) |
| `styling` | Style prompt describing the music | Yes (generate mode), optional (`complete`/`lego`) |
| `noblend` | Output generated instruments only without blending with original audio (`complete` only) | No |
| `duration` | Duration in seconds (10‑300) | Yes (generate mode) |
| `sfx "prompt/duration-position/level"` | SFX overlay spec for `bgm`/`complete` only: prompt (required), duration 5-30s (auto-clamped), position in seconds (required, non-negative, cannot exceed source duration), level 1-100% (optional, default: 50). Minus signs stripped from duration/level, invalid values = error, level clamped with warnings. Multiple `sfx:` specs allowed. SFX generated by TangoFlux; ACE-Step offloaded first. | No |
| `vc` | Enable voice conversion (place **before** lyrics/styling/duration) | No |
| `clone` | Voice reference audio path (required when `vc` is set). Multi-reference format: `(path1)(path2)(path3)` concatenates multiple references into one. Add `first` keyword before the refs (`clone first "(path1)(path2)"`) to extract only the first reference's speaker from all others via TSE before compiling | Yes (when vc is set) |
| `target` | Optional music reference (`target voice "ref.wav"` or `target music "ref.wav"`; supports stem spec: `target "drums/(ref.wav)"`) | No |
| `bias` | Style transfer strength for `remix`/`repaint` (0‑100, default 40) | No |
| `reference` | Reference audio for `remix`/`repaint`/`bgm`/`complete`/`lego` guidance (up to 3 entries with `voice`/`music` prefix; `reference voice "path"`, `reference music "path"`, or `reference "path"` for as-is; accepts audio, video, and URLs; multiple refs composed into 30s composite; supports optional stem spec `stem/(path)` and time spec — see below) | No |

**Reference Time Spec:**

The reference path can include an optional time spec to select a specific portion of the reference audio instead of using the entire file. This applies to all TTM sub-tasks that accept references.

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `nn(path)` | `"50(ref.wav)"` | Start at nn seconds, extract up to slot max |
| `nn-nn(path)` | `"20-30(ref.wav)"` | Use specified range; slides to reach slot max if shorter |
| `nn-nn/nn-nn/nn-nn(path)` | `"20-30/40-50(ref.wav)"` | Multiple ranges from same audio, combined to reach slot max |
| `stem/(path)` | `"drums/(ref.wav)"` | Extract a single stem from the reference audio via ACE-Step |
| `stem-stem/(path)` | `"bass-drums/(ref.wav)"` | Extract multiple stems and mix them together |
| `stem/nn-nn(path)` | `"drums/20-30(ref.wav)"` | Extract stem then cut to time range |

The time spec and stem spec are both optional -- `reference "ref.wav"` still works and uses the entire audio.

**Stem extraction** uses the ACE-Step XL-Base model to extract specific instrument tracks from the reference audio. The 12 available stems are: `woodwinds`, `brass`, `fx`, `synth`, `strings`, `percussion`, `keyboard`, `guitar`, `bass`, `drums`, `backing_vocals`, `vocals`. Multiple stems joined by `-` are extracted individually then mixed together. Stem extraction runs after SVS (voice/music) and before time-range cutting.

**Stem validation:** With `voice` prefix, only vocal stems (`vocals`, `backing_vocals`) are valid. With `music` prefix, only instrument stems are valid. As-is (no prefix) accepts all 12 stems. The `everything` keyword is rejected in references. Unrecognized stems are removed with a warning; valid stems proceed.

**Slot max by reference count:** 1 reference = 30s, 2 references = 15s each, 3 references = 10s each.

**Sliding logic:** If the specified range is shorter than the slot max, the start is slid back and/or the end is slid forward until the slot max duration is reached. If the audio is shorter than the slot max, segments loop to fill the slot. If the combined segments exceed the slot max, they are used as-is.

```bash
# Start at 50 seconds, extract up to 30s (1 ref slot max)
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "jazz" reference voice "50(ref.wav)"

# Use 20-30s range from first ref, 40-50s from second; each slides to 15s (2 ref slot max)
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "pop" reference "20-30(ref1.wav)" "40-50(ref2.wav)"

# Multiple ranges from same audio, combined to reach slot max
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "rock" reference music "20-30/40-50(ref.wav)"

# Time spec inside repaint multi-pass spec
python src/voder.py ttm repaint "song.wav" "20-80/styling(jazz)/reference-voice(30-60(vocals.wav))"

# Extract drums from reference audio
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "rock" reference "drums/(ref.wav)"

# Extract bass and drums from music, then cut to 30-60s
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "funk" reference music "bass-drums/30-60(ref.wav)"
```

| `repaint` | Source audio for section repaint; optional `voice`/`music` prefix for SVS isolation (`repaint voice "path"` or `repaint music "path"`) | Required for repaint sub-task |
| `"start-end/styling(...)/..."` | Multi-pass repaint spec (quoted string): time range `start-end` required; optional `/styling(text)`, `/lyrics(text)`, `/reference-voice(path)`, `/reference-music(path)`, `/reference(path)` (up to 3 per pass), `/bias/nn`. Multiple pass specs = multiple sequential repaint passes, each using previous result as source. | No (multi-pass mode) |
| `video` | Preserve video output for `complete`/`bgm` (downloads video from URL, merges back to .mp4) | No |
| `overdose` | Use enhanced quality mode (three‑tier ACE‑Step) | No |

**SFX Overlay Syntax (BGM and Complete sub‑tasks only):**

The `sfx:` parameter overlays generated sound effects onto the output audio. Syntax: `sfx "prompt/duration-position/level"`

| Component | Format | Rules |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `prompt` | Text description of the sound effect | Required. Any descriptive text. |
| `duration` | Integer, 5-30 seconds | Required. Auto-clamped to 5-30 range. Minus signs are stripped. Invalid (non-numeric) values produce an error. |
| `position` | Integer, non-negative seconds | Required. Place at N seconds into source audio. Cannot exceed source duration. Minus signs are stripped. Invalid values produce an error. |
| `level` | Integer, 1-100% | Optional, default: 50. Clamped to 1-100 with warnings. Minus signs are stripped. Invalid values produce an error. |

- Multiple `sfx:` specs are allowed; each generates and overlays a separate SFX
- SFX are generated by TangoFlux; ACE-Step is offloaded from GPU first to free memory
- In **BGM**: `music` is optional if `sfx:` specs are provided; SFX overlaid after BGM mixing, or directly on clean voice if no `music`
- In **Complete**: `add` is optional if `sfx:` specs are provided; `sfx:` cannot be used with `noblend`; if only `sfx:` with no `add`, the music model is not loaded; SFX overlaid after blend

**SFX Overlay Examples:**

| Spec | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `sfx "thunder rumbling/10-5/60"` | Thunder sound, 10s duration, at 5s position, 60% volume |
| `sfx "doorbell/5-12"` | Doorbell sound, 5s duration, at 12s position, 50% volume (default) |

| Electronic | "synthesizer, dance beat, energetic" |
| Instrumental | "ambient electronic, atmospheric, no vocals" |

> **Note:** The `ttm+vc` mode has been fully merged into TTM. The old command is no longer accepted — use `ttm vc` with `clone` for voice conversion. The `target` parameter in `ttm vc` mode is reserved for optional music references (`target voice` / `target music`).

### Text‑to‑Music + Voice Clone (merged into TTM)

> **Note:** The `ttm+vc` mode has been fully merged into TTM. The old command is no longer accepted. For the full feature set (including `clone` syntax, `remix`, `repaint`, `lego`, `target` for music references), use `ttm vc` directly. See [Text‑to‑Music (ttm)](#text-to-music-ttm) for the unified documentation.

Generate music using ACE‑Step then apply voice conversion using Seed‑VC.

```bash
python src/voder.py ttm vc lyrics "song lyrics" styling "style" duration 30 clone "voice.wav"
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `lyrics` | Song lyrics (use `"..."` for instrumental) | Yes |
| `styling` | Style prompt | Yes |
| `duration` | Duration in seconds (10-300) | Yes |
| `clone` | Voice reference audio path for voice conversion. Multi-reference format: `(path1)(path2)(path3)` concatenates multiple references into one | Yes |

**Note:** The `target` parameter in `ttm vc` mode is reserved for optional music references (`target voice "ref.wav"` or `target music "ref.wav"`). Use `clone` for voice conversion references.

**Memory optimisation:** This mode automatically releases the ACE‑Step model from GPU memory before loading Seed‑VC, reducing peak VRAM usage.

**Example:**
```bash
python src/voder.py ttm vc lyrics "Chorus:\nThis is our moment" styling "rock ballad" duration 30 clone "singer_reference.wav"
```

### Speech‑to‑Text (stt)

Transcribe audio, video, images, or platform URLs (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter) to text using Whisper. Supports timestamps, speaker diarization, batch processing, translation, overdose quality, and automatic result routing. **Translation**: add `translate` flag to translate transcribed speech to English (Whisper large-v3), or use `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` syntax for any-to-any translation across 76 languages via TranslateGemma 12B. **Overdose**: add `overdose` flag for enhanced transcription quality using VibeVoice ASR. **SVS pre‑cleanup**: SVS vocal separation runs automatically before transcription to improve accuracy. **Note:** `overdose` and bare `translate` (without parentheses) are mutually exclusive, but `overdose` and `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` are compatible.

**Basic transcription:**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav"
```

**Transcription with timestamps:**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" timestamp
```

**Transcription with speaker diarization (dialogue format):**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" dialogue
```

**Full transcription with timestamps, diarization, and result routing:**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" timestamp dialogue result "/output/transcript.txt"
```

**Transcription with translation to English:**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "french_audio.wav" translate timestamp result "/output/translated.txt"
```

**Transcription with any-to-any translation (TranslateGemma 12B):**
```bash
# Auto-detect source, translate to Arabic
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" translate "(auto-ar)" timestamp result "/output/arabic.txt"

# Shorthand: (ar) is equivalent to (auto-ar)
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" translate "(ar)" timestamp result "/output/arabic.txt"

# Japanese to English
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" translate "(ja-en)" result "/output/english.txt"

# Overdose + any-to-any translation (now compatible)
python src/voder.py stt "audio.wav" overdose translate "(auto-fr)" result "/output/french.txt"
```

**Transcription with overdose quality:**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "meeting.wav" overdose dialogue
```

**Subtitle sub‑task (burn subtitles onto video):**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle "video.mp4"
```

**Subtitle with translated subtitles (any-to-any via TranslateGemma 12B):**
```bash
# Translated subtitles: auto-detect source, translate to Arabic
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle translate "(auto-ar)" "video.mp4"

# Shorthand: (ar) is equivalent to (auto-ar)
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle translate "(ar)" "video.mp4"

# Translated subtitles with specific source-target
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle translate "(ja-en)" "japanese_video.mp4"
```

**Subtitle with sound enhancement:**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle se "noisy_video.mp4"
```

**Transcribe a YouTube video:**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" timestamp dialogue
```

**Transcribe an image (OCR):**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "screenshot.png"
```

**Batch transcription (multiple files):**
```bash
python src/voder.py stt "file1.wav" "file2.mp3" "file3.mp4" timestamp result "/output/batch/"
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `files` | One or more input file paths or URLs (positional arguments after `stt`) | Yes |
| `timestamp` | Include word‑level timestamps in the output | No |
| `dialogue` | Enable speaker diarization (requires HF_TOKEN) | No |
| `translate` | Translate transcribed speech to English (Whisper large-v3) | No |
| `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` | Any-to-any translation via TranslateGemma 12B (76 languages). Use `auto` for source auto-detection. `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)`. Examples: `translate (auto-ar)`, `translate (ar)`, `translate (ja-en)` | No |
| `overdose` | Use enhanced transcription quality (VibeVoice ASR) | No |
| `subtitle` | Burn VibeVoice ASR subtitles onto a video (auto‑implies `overdose`; video/URL only). Use `stt overdose subtitle` for clarity | No |
| `result` | Copy result file(s) to the specified path (file or directory) | No |

**Important:** `overdose` and bare `translate` (without parentheses) are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together. However, `overdose` and `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` are compatible — TranslateGemma decouples translation from ASR, allowing overdose-quality transcription with any-to-any translation. `subtitle` auto‑implies `overdose` (so `stt subtitle` and `stt overdose subtitle` are equivalent; explicit form recommended for clarity) and cannot be used with bare `translate` or with audio/text/image files.

**Supported Input Formats:**
- **Audio**: WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, AAC, M4A, WMA
- **Video**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WebM (audio auto‑extracted via FFmpeg)
- **Images**: PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF (text extracted via EasyOCR)
- **YouTube**: Direct platform URL (audio downloaded via yt-dlp after two-step verification)
- **Bilibili**: Direct Bilibili URL (audio downloaded via yt-dlp after two-step verification)
- **TikTok**: Direct TikTok URL (audio downloaded via yt-dlp after two-step verification)
- **Snapchat / Instagram / Facebook / X-Twitter**: Same pipeline — URL is verified (shape check + yt-dlp video verification) and audio is downloaded via yt-dlp

**Output Format:**

The transcription result is saved as a `.txt` file in the `results/` directory. The content varies by flags used:

| Flags Used | Output Format |
|------------|---------------|
| (none) | Plain text transcript |
| `timestamp` | Timestamped transcript with `[MM:SS.mmm → MM:SS.mmm]` segments |
| `dialogue` | Speaker‑labelled dialogue format (`Speaker 1: ...`, `Speaker 2: ...`) |
| `timestamp dialogue` | Both timestamps and speaker labels combined |
| `translate` | Plain text transcript translated to English |
| `translate timestamp` | Timestamped transcript translated to English |
| `overdose` | Enhanced accuracy plain text transcript (VibeVoice ASR) |
| `overdose dialogue` | Enhanced accuracy with speaker labels |
| `overdose subtitle` | Subtitled MP4 video (VibeVoice ASR, video/URL input only) |

**Diarization Output Example:**
```
[00:00.000 → 00:03.500] Speaker 1: Welcome everyone to today's meeting.
[00:03.500 → 00:07.200] Speaker 2: Thank you, let's get started with the agenda.
[00:07.200 → 00:12.100] Speaker 1: First item, we need to review the quarterly results.
```

**Batch Processing Notes:**
- When multiple input files are provided, each is transcribed independently.
- If `result` points to a directory, all output files are copied there.
- If `result` points to a file path, only the last result is copied (use directory for batch).

### Song Voice Separate (svs)

Separate vocals from music or extract instrumental tracks using the BS‑RoFormer model.

**Extract vocals:**
```bash
python src/voder.py svs "song.mp3" voice
```

**Extract instrumental:**
```bash
python src/voder.py svs "song.mp3" music
```

**Extract both (voice first, then music):**
```bash
python src/voder.py svs "song.mp3" both
```

**With result routing:**
```bash
python src/voder.py svs "song.mp3" voice result "/output/vocals.wav"
```

**From any supported platform URL:**
```bash
# Audio downloaded by default → WAV output
python src/voder.py svs "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." voice

# Add `video` keyword to download full video → MP4 output (one per stem)
python src/voder.py svs "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." voice video
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `file` | Input audio/video/URL | Yes |
| `voice` | Extract vocals stem | Yes* |
| `music` | Extract music/instrumental stem | Yes* |
| `both` | Extract both stems sequentially (voice first, then music) | Yes* |
| `result` | Output path | No |
| `video` | When source is a URL, download the full video (default: audio download). Output is MP4 with separated stem muxed back, one per stem. | No |

*Any one of `voice`, `music`, or `both` required.

### Speaker Language Conversion (merged into TTS)

> **Note:** The standalone `slc` mode has been merged into TTS as a sub‑task. The old `slc` command is no longer accepted. Use `tts slc` instead. See [SLC (Speaker Language Conversion) — TTS Sub‑task](#slc-speaker-language-conversion--tts-sub-task) for the unified documentation.

### Speakers Separator (ss)

Extract individual speakers from multi‑speaker audio using VibeVoice ASR. Each speaker's audio is saved as a separate file. With `blend`, each speaker's audio is mixed with the original non‑vocals (instrumental/background) track — useful for vlogs or recordings where you want to isolate a speaker while preserving background audio. With `video`, separated audio is muxed with the original video to produce MP4 output — useful for removing unwanted speakers from a video while keeping the visuals.

**Separate speakers from a meeting:**
```bash
python src/voder.py ss "meeting.wav"
```

**Separate speakers with result routing:**
```bash
python src/voder.py ss "podcast.mp4" result "/output/speakers/"
```

**Overdose mode (uses VibeVoice ASR instead of Whisper+Pyannote):**
```bash
python src/voder.py ss "meeting.wav" overdose

python src/voder.py ss "meeting.wav" overdose result "/output/speakers/"
```

**With blend (each speaker + non-vocals):**
```bash
python src/voder.py ss blend "vlog.wav"

python src/voder.py ss overdose se blend "noisy_conversation.wav"
```

**Target extraction with blend:**
```bash
python src/voder.py ss target "speaker_ref.wav" blend "conversation.wav"
```

**With video output (mux separated audio with original video):**
```bash
python src/voder.py ss video "interview.mp4"

python src/voder.py ss target "speaker_ref.wav" video "interview.mp4"

python src/voder.py ss video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

python src/voder.py ss overdose se blend video "vlog.mp4"
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `file` | Input audio or video file path (positional) | Yes |
| `result` | Output directory for separated speaker files | No |
| `overdose` | Use VibeVoice ASR instead of Whisper+Pyannote for enhanced separation | No |
| `se` | Apply sound enhancement before separation | No |
| `blend` | Blend each separated speaker with the original non-vocals (instrumental/background) track | No |
| `video` | Produce video output by muxing separated audio with original video frames (ignored for audio-only input) | No |
| `target` | Target voice reference for extracting a specific speaker | No |

**Note:** Requires 24GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ system memory for VibeVoice ASR model.

### Sound Enhancement (se)

Enhance audio by denoising, dereverberating, restoring clarity, and upscaling resolution. Supports speech, music, and mixed content through sub‑modes. Uses UniSE model from Alibaba's unified-audio project for speech enhancement and AudioSR for super‑resolution.

**Sub‑modes:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `se "path"` | Default UniSE sound enhancement (denoise, dereverb) |
| `se voice "path"` | SVS voice isolation + UniSE sound enhancement on vocals |
| `se voice blend "path"` | SVS voice isolation + UniSE sound enhancement on vocals, then blend enhanced vocals back with music |
| `se sr "path"` | AudioSR super‑resolution (basic model, 48kHz output) on full audio |
| `se sr music "path"` | SVS music isolation + AudioSR super‑resolution (basic model) on music, output upsampled music |
| `se sr music blend "path"` | SVS music isolation + AudioSR super‑resolution on music + UniSE sound enhancement on voice, blend at 48kHz |
| `se sr voice "path"` | SVS voice isolation + AudioSR super‑resolution (speech model) on vocals |
| `se sr voice blend "path"` | SVS voice isolation + AudioSR speech model on vocals, blend with music |
| `se sr voice music "path"` | SVS voice+music isolation + AudioSR speech model on vocals + basic model on music, auto‑blend |

**Default enhancement (UniSE):**
```bash
python src/voder.py se "noisy_audio.wav"
```

**Voice isolation + enhancement:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se voice "song.wav"
```

**Voice isolation + enhancement + blend with music:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se voice blend "song.wav"
```

**Super‑resolution (AudioSR basic, 48kHz output):**
```bash
python src/voder.py se sr "low_quality_audio.wav"
```

**Music super‑resolution:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se sr music "low_quality_music.wav"
```

**Music super‑resolution + voice enhancement + blend:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se sr music blend "song.wav"
```

**Voice super‑resolution (AudioSR speech model):**
```bash
python src/voder.py se sr voice "vocals.wav"
```

**Voice super‑resolution + blend with music:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se sr voice blend "song.wav"
```

**Full SR: speech model on vocals + basic model on music, auto‑blended:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se sr voice music "song.wav"
```

**Enhance audio from video:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se "recording.mp4"
```

**Enhance from URL (audio downloaded by default → WAV):**
```bash
python src/voder.py se "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
```

**Enhance from URL with `video` keyword (video downloaded → MP4 with enhanced audio muxed back):**
```bash
python src/voder.py se video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
python src/voder.py se voice video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
```

**Save to specific location:**
```bash
python src/voder.py se "audio.wav" result "/output/enhanced.wav"
```

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Description | Required |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| `file` | Input audio or video file path (positional) | Yes |
| `result` | Copy result to the specified path | No |
| `video` | When source is a URL, download the full video (default: audio download). Output is MP4 with enhanced audio muxed back. | No |

**Supported Input Formats:**
- **Audio**: WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, AAC, M4A
- **Video**: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV (audio auto‑extracted)

**Important Notes:**
- **Default mode**: UniSE speech enhancement outputs at 16kHz — best for noisy recordings, distant microphones, room echo removal
- **`voice` sub‑mode**: Isolates vocals via SVS first, then applies UniSE speech enhancement; `blend` recombines with instrumental
- **`sr` sub‑mode**: Uses AudioSR basic model for super‑resolution upscaling to 48kHz — ideal for restoring low‑bitrate or low‑sample‑rate audio
- **`sr music` sub‑mode**: Isolates music via SVS, then applies AudioSR basic model for music super‑resolution; `blend` also enhances voice with UniSE
- **`sr voice` sub‑mode**: Isolates vocals via SVS, then applies AudioSR speech model for voice‑specific super‑resolution; `blend` recombines with music
- **`sr voice music` sub‑mode**: Isolates vocals and music via SVS, applies AudioSR speech model on vocals and basic model on music, then auto‑blends both at 48kHz
- **AudioSR dependency**: `sr` sub‑modes require the `audiosr` package (install via `pip install audiosr`); first run downloads the AudioSR model (~4‑6GB)

**Output Example (default):**
```
Loading UniSE speech enhancement model...
Enhancing audio...
✓ Success! Output saved to: results/voder_se_20260408_120000.wav
```

**Output Example (sr):**
```
Loading AudioSR super-resolution model...
Upsampling audio to 48kHz...
✓ Success! Output saved to: results/voder_se_sr_20260408_120000.wav
```

### Sound Effects Generation (sfx)

## New CLI Features

The following features were added in the 04/08/2026 major update and are available to AI agents via CLI.

### Script Directives (Per-Line Control)

Append directives to dialogue lines for fine-grained control:

| Directive | Format | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `/time:nn` | `/time:5` | Position at 5 seconds from start |
| `/time:nn-nn` | `/time:10-3` | Position at 10s, cut 3s from end |
| `/time:nn+nn` | `/time:5+2` | Position at 5s, cut 2s from start |
| `/time:nn-nn+nn` | `/time:10-3+2` | Position at 10s, cut 3s from end, cut 2s from start |
| `/level:0-100` | `/level:75` | Volume level for this line (default: 100) |
| `/duration:1-30` | `/duration:10` | Duration for SFX lines (required for `sfx:`) |

**Example:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Welcome! /time:0 /level:100" "sfx: intro music /duration:5 /level:40 /time:0" "Sarah: Hello everyone! /time:6" voice "James: male" "Sarah: female"
```

### SFX Lines in Dialogue

Use `sfx:` as the character name to embed sound effects:

```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "sfx: door bell /duration:3 /level:60" "Sarah: Who's there?" voice "James: male" "Sarah: female"
```

### Cross-use Feature (Mix Generated and Cloned Voices)

Both TTS one-line mode supports mixing `voice` and `target` parameters in the same dialogue:

```bash
# TTS mode: James generated, Sarah cloned
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello!" "Sarah: Hi!" voice "James: male" target "Sarah: /path/to/sarah.wav"

# TTS mode with mixed voices: James cloned, Sarah generated
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Welcome!" "Sarah: Thanks!" target "James: /path/to/james.wav" voice "Sarah: female"
```

**Note:** A character cannot have both `voice` and `target` — each character must use one or the other.

### Universal: `result` Parameter

Copy the generated result file to any filesystem path. Works with **all modes** (tts, sts, ttm, stt, se, sfx, svs, ss) and sub‑tasks (`tts slc`).

```bash
# Copy TTS result to a specific directory
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" voice "male voice" result "/mnt/shared/output/"

# Copy STT transcript to a specific file
python src/voder.py stt "meeting.wav" timestamp result "/data/transcripts/meeting.txt"

# Copy music result
python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "Hello world" styling "pop" duration 30 result "/mnt/shared/music/"

# Copy sound enhancement result
python src/voder.py se "noisy.wav" result "/clean/audio.wav"

# Copy sound effect result
python src/voder.py sfx sound "thunder" duration 10 result "/sfx/thunder.wav"

# Copy SVS result
python src/voder.py svs "song.mp3" voice result "/output/vocals.wav"

# Copy SLC result
python src/voder.py tts slc "speech.wav" result "/output/english.wav"

# Copy SS result
python src/voder.py ss "meeting.wav" result "/output/speakers/"
```

- If the path ends with `/`, it is treated as a directory (created if needed).
- If the path does not end with `/`, it is treated as a file path (parent directories created if needed).
- The original result is always saved in `results/`; `result` creates an additional copy.

### STT‑Only: `timestamp` Flag

Include word‑level timestamps in STT transcription output.

```bash
python src/voder.py stt "interview.wav" timestamp
```

### STT‑Only: `dialogue` Flag

Enable speaker diarization to identify and label individual speakers. Requires HF_TOKEN (see [HF_TOKEN Setup for AI Agents](#hf_token-setup-for-ai-agents)).

```bash
python src/voder.py stt "meeting.wav" dialogue
```

### STT‑Only: `translate` Flag

Translate transcribed speech to English automatically.

```bash
python src/voder.py stt "french_audio.wav" translate
```

### STT‑Only: `overdose` Flag

Use enhanced transcription quality with VibeVoice ASR.

```bash
python src/voder.py stt "meeting.wav" overdose dialogue
```

**Note:** `overdose` and `translate` are mutually exclusive.

### STT‑Only: `subtitle` Flag

Burn VibeVoice ASR transcription as subtitles directly onto a video file. Auto‑implies `overdose` (VibeVoice ASR is required), so `stt subtitle` and `stt overdose subtitle` are equivalent; the explicit form is recommended for clarity. Only accepts video files and URLs — audio, text, and image files are rejected. Subtitles use Meta MMS-FA forced alignment for per-word timestamps, grouped into 3-5 word segments with accurate timing — no more whole-segment blocks that display for 10+ seconds. Overlapping speech from different speakers is shown on a second line beneath the primary speaker in cyan. Subtitles are dynamically positioned at the bottom of the frame regardless of resolution. Use `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` to produce translated subtitles (76 languages via TranslateGemma 12B) — the original text is aligned first for accurate timing, then each chunk is translated while preserving the original timing.

```bash
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle "video.mp4"
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle se "noisy_video.mp4"
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle translate "(auto-ar)" "video.mp4"
python src/voder.py stt overdose subtitle translate "(ar)" "video.mp4"
```

**Note:** `subtitle` cannot be used with bare `translate` or with non‑video files. `subtitle` with `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` is supported.

### URL Input

Pass a URL from YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, or X/Twitter directly as input for STT transcription or dialogue analysis. VODER verifies the URL with two-step detection (shape check + yt-dlp video verification) and downloads the audio automatically via yt-dlp.

```bash
# Transcribe a YouTube video
python src/voder.py stt "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" timestamp

# Transcribe with diarization
python src/voder.py stt "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ" dialogue

# Also works with Bilibili and TikTok
python src/voder.py stt "https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1xx411c7mD" timestamp
```

### Image File Input

Pass an image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) to STT mode. Text is extracted via EasyOCR and returned as a plain text transcript. This enables using images of scripts, subtitles, or screenshots as dialogue input.

```bash
# Extract text from an image
python src/voder.py stt "script_screenshot.png"

# Extract text and save to a specific path
python src/voder.py stt "subtitle_image.jpg" result "/output/extracted_text.txt"
```

### Batch File Processing (STT)

Provide multiple input files to STT mode for batch transcription. All files are processed sequentially.

```bash
# Transcribe multiple audio files
python src/voder.py stt "episode1.wav" "episode2.wav" "episode3.wav" timestamp

# Batch with result routing to a directory
python src/voder.py stt "meeting1.wav" "meeting2.wav" dialogue result "/data/transcripts/"
```

---

## GPU Requirements

### All Modes Run on CPU

VODER operates entirely on CPU. No GPU is required for any mode. This makes VODER accessible to users without NVIDIA graphics hardware. However, having a GPU with sufficient VRAM can significantly improve processing speed for certain modes.

### Memory Requirements by Mode

| Mode | RAM Required | GPU (CUDA) | VRAM | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------------|------|-------|
| TTS (no music) | 12GB | Optional | 4GB (minimum, GTX 1060) | 8GB base + 4GB (Qwen) |
| TTS (with music) | 23GB | Optional | 15GB (recommended, RTX 3080 or 16GB GPU) | 8GB base + 15GB (ACE) |
| TTS + Overdose | 48GB | Optional | 24GB VRAM or 48GB RAM | 8GB base + ~40GB (VibeVoice ASR) + 15GB (ACE XL, if music) |

### VRAM Guidelines

| VRAM | Performance | Suitable Modes |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| No GPU (CPU only) | Slow | All modes work on CPU |
| 4GB | Usable | TTS (no music), STT, SE, SFX, TTS SLC |
| 6GB | Minimum | TTS (no music), STT, SE, SFX, TTS SLC, SVS |
| 14GB | Mid-range | STS, all TTS modes, SE, SFX, SVS, TTS SLC |
| 15-16GB | Recommended | TTS with music, TTM, TTM vc, all standard modes |
| 24GB | High (RTX 4090) | All modes including SS, STT overdose, TTS overdose, TTM overdose |

| 48GB | Server-grade | All modes including SS, overdose modes on GPU |
| T4 (16GB) | Server-grade | All standard modes (not consumer GPU) |

**Note:** The T4 GPU has 16GB VRAM but is a server-grade GPU, not a typical consumer card like GTX 1660 Super.

### Modes Requiring More Memory

The following modes require approximately 23GB RAM due to the ACE-Step model:

- **TTM** (Text-to-Music)
- **TTM vc** (TTM with voice conversion)
- **TTS** with background music

The following modes require approximately 48GB RAM (or 24GB+ VRAM) for VibeVoice ASR:

- **STT** with `overdose` flag
- **TTS** with `overdose` flag
- **TTM** with `overdose` flag
- **TTM** `complete` sub-task
- **SS** (Speakers Separator)

### Modes Working With Less Memory

The following modes work with approximately 11-13GB RAM:

- **TTS** (Text-to-Speech) - 12GB
- **TTS** (Text-to-Speech, including voice cloning via `target`) - 12GB
- **TTS SLC** (Speaker Language Conversion via `tts slc`) - 18GB
- **STT** (Speech-to-Text) - 12GB
- **STS** (Speech-to-Speech) - 13GB
- **SE** (Sound Enhancement) - 11GB (base); up to 17GB with AudioSR
- **SFX** (Sound Effects) - 12GB
- **SVS** (Song Voice Separate) - 14GB

### Verify System Memory

```bash
# Check available RAM
free -h
```

## Limitations

### CLI Mode Limitations

1. **No Real‑time Preview**: Cannot see waveform during processing
2. **No Visual Audio Management**: Cannot drag‑and‑drop reference files
3. **Single Mode for STS/TTM/TTM vc**: These modes do not support multi‑speaker dialogue in CLI
4. **Music only for Dialogue**: `music` parameter is ignored in single mode

### STT Mode Limitations

1. **Diarization Requires HF_TOKEN**: Speaker diarization needs a valid HuggingFace token with accepted model conditions
2. **YouTube Download Requires Internet**: URL-based transcription needs network access and yt-dlp installed
3. **Image OCR Accuracy Varies**: Text extraction quality depends on image resolution, font clarity, and language support
4. **Speaker Diarization Accuracy Varies**: Best results with clear audio, minimal background noise, and ≤4 speakers; overlapping speech and noisy environments reduce accuracy
5. **Overdose Not Available with Translation**: The `overdose` and `translate` flags are mutually exclusive and cannot be used together
6. **Subtitle Video Only**: The `subtitle` flag only accepts video files and URLs — audio, text, and image files are rejected

### SVS Mode Limitations

1. **Limited to Vocal/Music Separation**: SVS separates only vocals from music/instrumental tracks; other stem types (drums, bass, etc.) are not supported
2. **Source Quality Dependent**: Separation quality depends heavily on the source audio mix and clarity of the original recording

### SLC Mode Limitations (TTS Sub‑task)

1. **Translation Quality Depends on Whisper large-v3**: Translation accuracy depends on Whisper large-v3's transcription accuracy for the source language
2. **English Only**: Output is always English (Whisper can only translate to English, not between arbitrary language pairs)
3. **Music Sync**: When using the `music` flag, voice-music synchronization may vary; this is inherent to the approach

### SS Mode Limitations

1. **High Hardware Requirements**: Requires 24GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ system memory for the VibeVoice ASR model
2. **Speaker Count**: Best results with 2-6 speakers; performance degrades with higher speaker counts

### SE Mode Limitations

1. **Default Mode — Speech Only**: The base `se "path"` mode uses UniSE sound enhancement and is optimized for speech; music may be degraded. Use `se sr music` for music content instead
2. **16kHz Output (default)**: Default UniSE sound enhancement outputs at 16kHz sample rate. Use `se sr` sub‑modes for 48kHz output
3. **Cannot Recover Missing Data**: Severely corrupted audio has restoration limits
4. **AudioSR Model Size**: `sr` sub‑modes require downloading the AudioSR model (~4‑6GB on first use)

### SFX Mode Limitations

1. **Duration Limit**: Maximum 30 seconds per sound effect
2. **Prompt Sensitivity**: Results vary based on prompt quality
3. **No Multi-file Batch**: Each SFX command generates one sound effect

### GUI Mode Limitations

1. **No Batch Processing**: Must process files one at a time manually
2. **No Command Chaining**: Cannot chain multiple operations
3. **Display Required**: Requires X11/Wayland display server
4. **Interactive Only**: Cannot run fully automated pipelines

### FFmpeg Dependencies

1. **Video Input Requires FFmpeg**: Without FFmpeg, video file audio extraction fails
2. **Audio Resampling Requires FFmpeg**: Sample rate conversion needs FFmpeg
3. **Audio Concatenation Requires FFmpeg**: Dialogue segment joining needs FFmpeg
4. **Music Mixing Requires FFmpeg**: Dialogue + background music mixing needs FFmpeg

### Model Download Requirements

1. **First Run Downloads Models**: Initial run downloads models from HuggingFace (GB‑sized)
2. **HuggingFace Token May Be Required**: Some models require authentication
3. **Local Cache Location**: Models cached in `./models/` and `./checkpoints/` directories

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Voice conversion fails immediately

**Cause**: Insufficient system memory

**Solution**: Verify you have enough RAM:

```bash
# Check available RAM
free -h
```

For STS mode, ensure at least 13GB RAM is available. For TTM or TTS with music, ensure at least 23GB RAM is available.

### Issue: Out of memory errors

**Cause**: Model too large for available system memory

**Solution**:
- For TTS without music: Ensure at least 12GB RAM available
- For TTS with music, TTM, or TTM vc: Ensure at least 23GB RAM available
- For STS: Ensure at least 13GB RAM available
- For STT with diarization: Ensure at least 15GB RAM available
- For STT with overdose, TTM with overdose, TTM complete, or SS: Ensure at least 48GB RAM available (or 24GB+ VRAM)
- Reduce TTM duration (shorter audio = less memory)
- Process shorter audio segments for STS
- Use TTS modes instead of voice conversion modes

### Issue: Module not found errors

**Cause**: Python dependencies not installed

**Solution**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue: FFmpeg not found errors

**Cause**: FFmpeg not installed or not in system PATH

**Solution**: Install FFmpeg separately (see FFmpeg Setup section)

### Issue: Dialogue mode not working in one‑liner

**Cause**: Missing or incorrectly ordered `voice`/`target` parameters

**Solution**: Ensure each character in the script has a corresponding `voice` (or `target`) entry **in the same character order**. Example:

```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: deep voice" "Sarah: cheerful voice"
```

### Issue: Background music not added even though `music` parameter is supplied

**Cause**: The command is not in dialogue mode (i.e., all `script` parameters are plain text without colon). Background music is only available for dialogue scripts.

**Solution**: Use `Character: text` format for at least one script parameter, or use multiple script lines with colon format.

### Issue: SFX line missing duration error

**Cause**: SFX lines require `/duration:nn` directive

**Solution**: Add duration to SFX lines:
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "sfx: thunder /duration:5" voice "James: male"
```

### Issue: Sound enhancement degrades music

**Cause**: Default SE mode (`se "path"`) uses UniSE speech enhancement which is optimized for speech only

**Solution**: Use `se sr music "path"` for music content, `se sr music blend "path"` to enhance both voice and music, or `se sr voice music "path"` for SR on both stems

### Issue: Sound effect doesn't match prompt

**Cause**: Insufficient guidance or prompt quality

**Solution**: 
- Increase `guide` parameter (try 7-10)
- Make prompts more descriptive
- Increase `steps` for better quality

### Issue: Music generation is slow or fails

**Cause**: ACE‑Step model loading time; insufficient resources; empty music description

**Solution**: 
- Ensure `music` description is not empty.
- Use CPU mode if GPU not available (slower but works).
- Reduce dialogue length (shorter music duration = faster generation).

### Issue: Slow processing

**Cause**: Running on CPU without GPU acceleration (for STS or TTM vc modes)

**Solution**: Use NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM for acceleration, or use TTS or TTM modes which work on CPU

### Issue: HuggingFace model download fails

**Cause**: Network issues or authentication required

**Solution**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Add HuggingFace token to `HF_TOKEN.txt` file
3. Retry after clearing cache: `rm -rf ./models ./checkpoints`

### Issue: Voice cloning produces poor results

**Cause**: Poor quality reference audio

**Solution**: Use high‑quality reference audio:
- 5‑30 seconds duration
- Clear speech, minimal background noise
- Single speaker, no music
- Consistent volume levels

### Issue: Pyannote speaker diarization fails

**Cause**: Missing or invalid HF_TOKEN, model conditions not accepted, or torchaudio compatibility issues

**Solution**:
1. Ensure `HF_TOKEN.txt` exists in the VODER root directory with a valid token
2. Visit https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1 and accept the model conditions
3. Visit https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0 and accept the model conditions
4. Verify the token has read access: `python -c "from huggingface_hub import HfFolder; print(HfFolder.get_token())"`
5. Ensure `torchaudio` is compatible: `pip install torchaudio --upgrade`
6. If using CUDA, verify torchaudio CUDA version matches PyTorch: `python -c "import torchaudio; print(torchaudio.__version__)"`

### Issue: YouTube download fails

**Cause**: Network connectivity issues, video unavailable or region‑locked, or yt-dlp not installed

**Solution**:
1. Verify internet connectivity: `curl -I https://www.youtube.com`
2. Ensure yt-dlp is installed: `pip install yt-dlp` and upgrade: `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`
3. Verify the URL is correct and the video is publicly accessible
4. Try downloading manually first: `yt-dlp "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"`
5. If the video is age‑restricted or private, it cannot be processed

### Issue: EasyOCR not extracting text from images

**Cause**: Poor image quality, unsupported format, or text too small/blurry

**Solution**:
1. Ensure the image is a supported format (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP, TIFF)
2. Use higher resolution images (at least 300 DPI for scanned documents)
3. Ensure text is clearly visible with good contrast
4. Crop the image to the text region if possible
5. Pre-process: increase contrast and convert to grayscale for better results

### Issue: STT diarization producing poor results

**Cause**: Overlapping speech, excessive background noise, too many speakers, or poor audio quality

**Solution**:
1. Use audio with minimal background noise
2. For best results, limit to 2‑4 speakers
3. Avoid audio with frequent overlapping speech
4. Pre-process audio with noise reduction if possible
5. Ensure audio sample rate is at least 16kHz
6. For YouTube URLs, download quality may vary — consider downloading manually with yt-dlp first

### Issue: SVS separation quality is poor

**Cause**: Source audio has complex mix, low quality, or poorly separated stems

**Solution**:
1. Use higher quality source audio (320kbps MP3 or lossless)
2. Ensure source is properly mixed (vocals not buried in effects)
3. Pre-process with sound enhancement for better vocal extraction

### Issue: SLC translation produces incorrect output

**Cause**: Source language not well supported by Whisper large-v3, or unclear speech

**Solution**:
1. Ensure source audio is clear with minimal background noise
2. Pre-process with sound enhancement (`se` mode) before SLC
3. Use shorter audio segments for better accuracy
4. SLC always uses Whisper large-v3 (not turbo) for maximum accuracy
5. Note: SLC is now a TTS sub‑task — use `tts slc "path.wav"` instead of the old standalone `slc` command

### Issue: SS fails with out of memory

**Cause**: VibeVoice ASR requires 24GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ system memory

**Solution**:
1. Verify available memory: `free -h` (need 48GB+ RAM) or `nvidia-smi` (need 24GB+ VRAM)
2. Process shorter audio segments to reduce memory pressure
3. Use STT with `dialogue` flag as an alternative for speaker identification

### Issue: TTM overdose or complete sub-task fails

**Cause**: VibeVoice ASR + three‑tier ACE‑Step require significant memory

**Solution**:
1. Ensure 32GB+ VRAM or 48GB+ system memory available
2. Use standard TTM mode (without overdose) if resources are limited
3. Reduce duration for overdose mode to lower memory requirements

### Justification: VODER Has No Known Systemic Issues

VODER is a mature tool with all modes fully operational. When issues occur, they are almost always due to:

1. **Missing Python libraries**: Solved by `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **FFmpeg not in PATH**: Solved by FFmpeg installation
3. **Insufficient GPU VRAM**: Use modes that work on CPU or upgrade GPU
4. **Poor reference audio quality**: Use clear, single‑speaker audio samples
5. **Model download failures**: Check network or add HuggingFace token
6. **Misuse of music parameter**: Only valid in dialogue mode
7. **Missing HF_TOKEN for diarization**: Create `HF_TOKEN.txt` with valid token
8. **yt-dlp not installed**: Install via `pip install yt-dlp`
9. **Poor OCR input quality**: Use high‑resolution, high‑contrast images
10. **SE used on music**: Default SE is speech-only; use `se sr music` for music content, `se sr voice music` for both
11. **SFX missing duration**: Add `/duration:nn` to SFX lines
12. **SS/overdose insufficient memory**: Ensure 48GB+ RAM or 24GB+ VRAM
13. **STT overdose + translate conflict**: These flags are mutually exclusive (STT mode only; SLC always translates to English)

VODER handles all internal error cases gracefully with clear error messages.

```

### Workflow 8: Interactive Dialogue Creation with Background Music (Semi‑Automated)

For complex scripts where you want to decide about music interactively:

```bash
python src/voder.py cli
# Select option 1 (TTS) — voice cloning and SLC are now part of TTS
# Enter multiple lines of dialogue (empty line to finish)
# Include SFX lines with: sfx: description /duration:nn
# Or provide audio/video/URL to trigger the "modify speech?" flow
# VODER will automatically prompt you for voice prompts / audio paths per character
# Then it will ask: "Add background music? (y/N):"
# Answer y and enter a description, or just press Enter to skip
```

### Workflow 9: Batch Transcription with Timestamps and Diarization

```bash
# Setup HF_TOKEN for diarization
echo "hf_your_token_here" > HF_TOKEN.txt

# Transcribe multiple meeting recordings with timestamps and speaker labels
python src/voder.py stt "meeting_2026-01.wav" "meeting_2026-02.wav" "meeting_2026-03.wav" timestamp dialogue result "/data/transcripts/"

# Extract text from a script screenshot
python src/voder.py stt "script_page.png" result "/output/extracted_script.txt"

# Extract text from a subtitle image and use as TTS input
python src/voder.py stt "subtitles.jpg" result "/output/subtitle_text.txt"

# Chain: extract from image, then use extracted text for TTS
python src/voder.py stt "notes.png" result "/tmp/notes.txt" && \
SCRIPT=$(cat /tmp/notes.txt) && \
python src/voder.py tts script "$SCRIPT" voice "professional narrator"
```

### Workflow 12: Complete Audio Production Pipeline

```bash
# 1. Enhance source audio (default SE)
python src/voder.py se "raw_recording.wav" result "/clean/audio.wav"

# 2. Transcribe with diarization
python src/voder.py stt "/clean/audio.wav" timestamp dialogue result "/script/dialogue.txt"

python src/voder.py ss "meeting.wav" result "/output/speakers/"

# 2. Transcribe each separated speaker individually
python src/voder.py stt "/output/speaker_1.wav" timestamp result "/output/speaker_1.txt"
python src/voder.py stt "/output/speaker_2.wav" timestamp result "/output/speaker_2.txt"

# 3. Enhance each speaker's audio
python src/voder.py se "/output/speaker_1.wav" result "/output/enhanced_speaker_1.wav"
python src/voder.py se "/output/speaker_2.wav" result "/output/enhanced_speaker_2.wav"
```

### Workflow 16: Music Production with Overdose Quality

```bash
# Generate music with enhanced quality
python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "Verse 1:\nWalking through the rain\nFeeling no pain" styling "melancholic indie rock" duration 60 overdose result "/music/high_quality.wav"

# Generate with voice conversion and overdose (vc flag before lyrics, clone for voice ref)
python src/voder.py ttm overdose vc lyrics "Chorus:\nWe'll rise again" styling "epic orchestral" duration 30 clone "singer.wav" result "/music/epic_cover.wav"
```

### Workflow 17: URL → Audio File (Side-Quest)

Fetch audio from a URL into `results/` without running any voder engine work. Useful as a standalone downloader or as the first chain in a pipeline.

```bash
# Download a YouTube URL as audio (MP3, default)
python src/voder.py quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." result "/output/track.mp3"

# Download as video (MP4) instead
python src/voder.py quest download video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." result "/output/clip.mp4"

# Extract audio from a local video file (refuses URLs and audio files)
python src/voder.py quest noframes "interview.mp4" result "/output/interview.wav"
```

### Workflow 18: Multi-Step Pipeline in a Single Command (Chains)

Chains wire multiple voder tasks together end-to-end. Each chain's output feeds later chains; intermediate outputs stay in `temp_chains/` and only the last chain's output reaches `results/`. This is ideal for AI agents that want to run a full pipeline (download → process → output) in a single command without manual file management.

```bash
# Pipeline: generate a song → isolate vocals → voice-convert them
python src/voder.py chains "song" ttm lyrics "la la la" styling "pop" 30 / "voice" svs voice "song" / "cover" sts base "voice" target "ref.wav"

# Pipeline: isolate vocals → enhance → transcribe
python src/voder.py chains "vocals" svs voice "song.wav" / "enhanced" se voice "vocals" / "text" stt "enhanced" timestamp

# Pipeline: download audio from URL → transcribe it
python src/voder.py chains "audio" quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." / "text" stt "audio" timestamp result "/output/transcript.txt"

# Pipeline: train a voice from a song's vocals, then speak with that voice
python src/voder.py chains "vocal" svs voice "song.wav" / "trained" train voice:singer "vocal" / "spoken" tts script "Hello world" voice "singer"
```

**Why chains matter for AI agents:** instead of writing shell scripts that orchestrate multiple voder calls with intermediate file paths, the agent writes a single `chains` command. VODER handles the temp file management, name indexing, and validation (duplicate names, empty chains) internally. The agent only needs to know the chain names it chose.
