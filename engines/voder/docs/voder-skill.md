# VODER Skill for AI Agents

## Overview

VODER is a professional-grade voice processing tool that provides **8 distinct audio transformation modes** in a unified CLI interface and three task-layer features (voice training, side-quests, and chains) that build on top of the modes. This skill enables AI agents to leverage VODER's full potential for complex audio processing workflows that would be impossible or extremely difficult without this knowledge.

The eight modes are: **TTS** (Text-to-Speech with optional voice cloning, SLC sub-task, SVC sub-task, and interactive modify-speech), **STS** (Speech-to-Speech voice conversion), **TTM** (Text-to-Music with optional voice cloning), **STT** (Speech-to-Text transcription), **SE** (Sound Enhancement), **SFX** (Sound Effects generation), **SVS** (Source/Track Vocal Separation), and **SS** (Speaker Separation).

The three task-layer features are: **`train`** (save reusable voice clones as `.tts` / `.ttse` files for later use in TTS), **`quest`** (side-quests — lightweight utility tasks like URL download and audio manipulation, extensible via a `SIDE_QUESTS` registry), and **`chains`** (user-defined pipelines that wire any number of voder oneline tasks together end-to-end).

> **Note**: SLC (Spoken Language Conversion / Dubbing) is now a TTS oneline sub-task (`tts slc`), not a standalone mode. SVC (Speaker Voice Change) is another TTS oneline sub-task (`tts svc`). STT+TTS (transcribe → edit → resynthesize) is now integrated into TTS interactive mode as a "modify speech?" prompt, not a standalone mode.

**Core Philosophy**: VODER prioritizes **quality over speed**. There are no "fast" or "degraded" model options. The tool uses the best available models (Whisper large-v3-turbo / large-v3, Qwen3-TTS, Seed-VC, ACE-Step XL-Turbo / XL-Base / 1.5, BS-RoFormer Resurrection, VibeVoice ASR, Pyannote, UniSE, AudioSR, TangoFlux) to produce professional-quality output.

| SVS | 2.7 | Audio/Video/URL | Audio (stems) | ✅ Full |
| SS | 2.8 | Audio/Video/URL | Audio + Text | ✅ Full |

The 3 task-layer features:

| Feature | Section | Input Type | Output Type | One-Liner Support |
|---------|---------|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Voice Training | 2.1a | Audio | .tts / .ttse file | ✅ Full (oneline only) |
| Side-Quests | 2.9 | URL / local video / local audio | Audio / Video file | ✅ Full — `quest download` (standalone fetch) + Media Manipulation category (Sound Effects / Audio Editing / Format & File sub-categories — 17 quests total). Run `quest` with no args for the live grouped tree. |
| Chains | 2.10 | A sequence of voder oneline commands | Final chain output | ✅ Full (pipeline of named chains) |

> **Note**: `tts+vc` and `ttm+vc` are no longer accepted as commands and will produce an error. Use `tts` with `target` for voice cloning, and `ttm` with `vc` + `clone` for voice conversion in TTM. SLC is now a TTS sub-task (`tts slc`), not a standalone mode. STT+TTS is now integrated into TTS interactive mode.

## 2.1 TTS (Text-to-Speech with Voice Design & Voice Cloning)

### What It Is
TTS mode generates human-like speech from text input. It supports two synthesis paths in a single unified mode:

1. **Voice Design** (`voice` parameter): Creates voices from scratch based on natural language descriptions using Qwen3-TTS VoiceDesign. You can describe voices that don't exist in any database — a "weathered old sailor with a gravelly voice" or a "cheerful AI assistant with a slight metallic quality."

2. **Voice Cloning** (`target` parameter): Generates speech that sounds like a specific real person from a reference audio file using Qwen3-TTS Base's built-in cloning capability. The reference audio can be a recording of anyone (with ethical consent), and the output will match their voice characteristics.

Both paths can be **mixed in the same dialogue** using the cross-use feature — some characters designed, others cloned.

> **Note**: The old `tts+vc` command is no longer accepted. Use `tts` with the `target` parameter instead.

### How It Works

**Voice Design Path:**
1. **Voice Prompt Interpretation**: The model parses your voice description to extract characteristics (age, gender, tone, pace, accent)
2. **Speech Synthesis**: Text is converted to mel-spectrograms based on the voice characteristics
3. **Audio Generation**: Spectrograms are converted to waveform audio

**Voice Cloning Path (IMPORTANT: Uses Qwen3-TTS Base Built-in Cloning):**

**Voice cloning does NOT use Seed-VC**. It uses **Qwen3-TTS Base's built-in voice cloning capability**:

1. **Voice Embedding Extraction**: Qwen3-TTS Base's `create_voice_clone_prompt()` method analyzes the reference audio and extracts a voice embedding (x-vector) using `x_vector_only_mode=True`
2. **Direct Synthesis with Clone**: The `generate_voice_clone()` method synthesizes the text **directly with the cloned voice characteristics embedded** — this is NOT a two-step process (synthesis then conversion), but a single integrated process
3. **Consistency Optimization**: In dialogue mode, the voice embedding is extracted **once per character** at the start and reused for all their lines

**Why This Matters**: Unlike a two-stage process (synthesize → convert), Qwen3-TTS Base's integrated cloning produces more natural results because the voice characteristics are considered during the entire synthesis process, not applied as a transformation afterward.

**Shared Path:**
4. **Optional Music Addition**: If `music` parameter is provided, ACE-Step generates background music that matches the dialogue duration

### TTS Overdose Mode

When the `overdose` flag is added to TTS, it activates an enhanced processing pipeline for dialogue source analysis and voice clip extraction:

- **VibeVoice ASR instead of Whisper+Pyannote**: TTS overdose uses VibeVoice ASR for dialogue source analysis and voice clip extraction, providing superior speaker diarization with native speaker identification — no separate Pyannote step needed
- **Safer voice clip extraction**: Voice clips extracted with overdose trim the first 2 seconds and last 3 seconds from the longest segment per speaker, avoiding cross-speaker overlap at segment boundaries and producing cleaner reference audio for cloning
- **ACE-Step XL Turbo for music**: When `music` is also specified alongside `overdose`, ACE-Step XL Turbo is used instead of the standard ACE-Step 1.5 for background music generation, producing higher quality music

```bash
# TTS overdose with voice design
python src/voder.py tts overdose script "James: Hello" "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: deep male" "Sarah: cheerful female"

# TTS overdose with voice cloning and music (XL Turbo for bgm)
python src/voder.py tts overdose script "A: line" "B: line" target "A: ref.wav" "B: ref.wav" music "ambient"
```

### TTS Extreme Mode

When the `extreme` flag is added to TTS, it switches the TTS engine from Qwen3-TTS to **Fish Audio S2-Pro**, providing higher quality voice cloning, 80+ language support, and voice effects:

- **Fish Audio S2-Pro instead of Qwen3-TTS**: All TTS synthesis steps use Fish S2-Pro's dual-autoregressive architecture (4B + 400M parameters) for superior voice cloning quality and natural prosody
- **80+ languages**: Fish S2-Pro supports over 80 languages natively, compared to Qwen3-TTS's 10. This enables voice design for Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Turkish, and 70+ additional languages
- **Voice effects via `[tag]` syntax**: S2-Pro well-tested tags control emotions (`[excited]`, `[angry]`, `[sad]`), tones (`[whispering]`, `[soft voice]`, `[low voice]`, `[loud voice]`, `[shouting]`), breathing (`[sigh]`, `[inhale]`, `[exhale]`, `[gasp]`, `[panting]`, `[clears throat]`), vocal sounds (`[laughing]`, `[chuckling]`, `[giggle]`, `[sobbing]`, `[crying]`, `[groan]`), pacing (`[pause]`, `[short pause]`, `[long pause]`), and special effects (`[emphasis]`, `[rustling sound]`). 64 S1 Pro tags also work in `[brackets]` (e.g., `(furious)`, `(sarcastic)`, `(screaming)`, `(audience laughing)`). Over 15,000 free-form tags are supported including multi-language tags (e.g., `[低声说]` for Chinese). Tags affect text from their position onward
- **Voice Design with extreme mode**: When `extreme` is used with a `voice` prompt (not `target`), VODER always generates placeholder English speech via VoiceDesign, clones it with Fish, then Fish speaks the actual text. This applies unconditionally to ensure consistent voice quality and preserve voice effects tags across all languages
- **Can combine with overdose**: `extreme` and `overdose` affect different parts of the pipeline (overdose = STT/TTM, extreme = TTS) and can be used simultaneously
- **`.ttse` trained voices**: Extreme mode uses `.ttse` files (from `train extreme voice:name`) instead of `.tts` files. A clear error is shown on mismatch

```bash
# TTS extreme with voice cloning
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "Hello world" target "voice.wav"

# TTS extreme with voice effects
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "[whispering] Hello there [pause] how are you?" target "voice.wav"

# TTS extreme + overdose combined
python src/voder.py tts overdose extreme script "James: Hello" target "James: james.wav" music "soft piano"

# TTS extreme with voice design (placeholder trick for all languages)
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "Arabic text here" voice "deep male"

# TTS extreme with trained .ttse voice
python src/voder.py tts extreme script "Hello" voice "my-character"

# Extreme SLC
python src/voder.py tts extreme slc "foreign_speech.wav"

# Extreme SVC
python src/voder.py tts extreme svc "speech.wav" target "voice_ref.wav"
```

**Multi-speaker note**: Fish S2-Pro supports native multi-speaker in one pass using `Name: text` syntax (e.g., `SARAH: [sigh] I made coffee. DANIEL: [long pause] Yeah. Thanks.`) or via internal `<|speaker:i|>` tokens, but VODER's dialogue mode is recommended over this feature as it provides better per-character voice control and mixing.

### When to Use Voice Design vs Voice Cloning

| Scenario | Voice Design (`voice`) | Voice Cloning (`target`) |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Fictional characters | ✅ Ideal | ❌ No reference exists |
| Brand-consistent content | ✅ If voice profile defined | ✅ If reference available |
| Localization | ✅ Possible | ✅ Better — preserves identity |
| Accessibility | ❌ No reference | ✅ Use familiar voice |
| Podcast/narration | ✅ Full control | ✅ Match existing host |
| Testing/prototyping | ✅ Fast iteration | ❌ Need reference first |

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Single Mode | Dialogue Mode |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| `script` | Yes | Text to synthesize | Single text string | Multiple `"Char: text"` strings |
| `voice` | Yes* | Voice description or trained voice | Single prompt or trained voice name | `"Char: prompt"` per character or `"Char: trained-name"` |
| `target` | No* | Voice reference file | Single path or multi-ref `(path1)(path2)` | `"Char: /path/to/file.wav"` or `"Char:(ref1.wav)(ref2.wav)"` |
| `music` | No | Background music style | Ignored | Single description |
| `level` | No | Music volume | Ignored | Volume specification |
| `reference` | No | Reference audio/video/URL for bgm style guidance | Ignored | Single path (processed via SVS music pipe to extract clean instrumental) |
| `overdose` | No | Use VibeVoice ASR for source analysis + safer voice clip extraction; XL Turbo for bgm when `music` is set | Ignored | Flag only |
| `extreme` | No | Use Fish Audio S2-Pro for TTS synthesis; 80+ languages, voice effects `[tag]` tags (S2-Pro + S1 Pro), `.ttse` trained voices | Ignored | Flag only |
| `result` | No | Output destination | Path | Path |

*Either `voice` or `target` required for non-SFX lines. Can mix both using cross-use feature. If `target` is provided without `voice`, voice cloning path is used automatically. The `voice` parameter also accepts trained voice references — see **Trained Voice Usage** below.

### Trained Voice Usage in TTS

When using the `voice` parameter, a trained voice name or path can be used instead of a voice description. When a trained voice is used, the corresponding TTS model (Qwen3-TTS Base for `.tts`, Fish S2-Pro for `.ttse`) is used instead of VoiceDesign.

| Syntax | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| `voice "character-name"` | Uses the latest `.tts` (or `.ttse` with `extreme`) file with that name from `voices/` |
| `voice "character-name:path/to/file.tts"` | Uses a specific `.tts` file (standard mode only) |
| `voice "character-name:path/to/file.ttse"` | Uses a specific `.ttse` file (extreme mode only) |
| `voice "character-name:another-name"` | Uses the latest `.tts` (or `.ttse`) file for `another-name` from `voices/` |

This works in both oneline and interactive CLI modes. Using a `.tts` file with `extreme` or a `.ttse` file without `extreme` produces an error.

```bash
# Single mode with trained voice
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" voice "my-character"

# Dialogue with trained voices
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: hero" voice "Sarah: heroine"

# Mix trained and described voices
python src/voder.py tts script "James: Hello" "Sarah: Hi" voice "James: hero" voice "Sarah: cheerful female"

# Specific .tts file
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello" voice "narrator:voices/voder_tts_narrator_20260101.tts"
```

### Newline Support in TTS Scripts

Use `\n` in script text for actual newlines. Works in both oneline and interactive CLI modes.

```bash
# Newline in dialogue script
python src/voder.py tts script "James: First line\nSecond line" voice "James: deep male"

# Newline in single mode
python src/voder.py tts script "First paragraph\nSecond paragraph" voice "professional narrator"
```

### SLC Sub-Task (Spoken Language Conversion / Dubbing)

SLC (Spoken Language Conversion) is now a TTS oneline sub-task that translates spoken content from any language to English and re-synthesizes it with the original speaker's voice. It combines Whisper large-v3's translation capability with Qwen3-TTS's voice synthesis to produce **dubbed audio** — the content is translated but the voice character is preserved. Translation to English is performed by default; no separate `translate` flag is needed. For any-to-any translation (76 languages), use the `translate (source-target)` syntax (or shorthand `translate (target)`, which auto-detects the source) which employs TranslateGemma 12B instead of Whisper for the translation step.

**How It Works:**
1. **Source Input**: Accepts audio files, video files, and URLs from any supported platform (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter)
2. **SVS Voice Isolation**: BS-RoFormer isolates the voice from the source (handles mixed audio/video)
3. **Music Extraction** (optional): When the `music` flag is used, SVS also extracts the instrumental track for later blending
4. **Translation**: Whisper large-v3 (not turbo) transcribes and translates the isolated voice to English. If `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` is specified, TranslateGemma 12B handles any-to-any translation instead
5. **Voice Extraction**: The source audio's voice characteristics are analyzed
6. **Re-Synthesis**: Qwen3-TTS Base synthesizes the English text with the extracted voice
7. **Overdose Post-Processing** (optional): When `tts overdose slc` is used, Seed-VC v2 runs a non-mimic pass after TTS output for better voice preservation
8. **Music Blending** (optional): When the `music` flag is used, the extracted instrumental is blended with the voice output

**Command Catalog:**

```bash
# Same-voice translation (preserves original speaker's voice)
python src/voder.py tts slc "foreign_speech.wav"

# Translation with music preservation (blend non-vocals back)
python src/voder.py tts slc music "foreign_speech.wav"

# From video file (audio auto-extracted)
python src/voder.py tts slc "foreign_movie.mp4"

# From YouTube URL
python src/voder.py tts slc "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# With output routing
python src/voder.py tts slc "spanish_interview.mp3" result "/output/english_version.wav"

# Overdose SLC — runs STS v2 non-mimic pass after TTS for better voice preservation
python src/voder.py tts overdose slc "foreign_speech.wav"

# Overdose SLC with music preservation
python src/voder.py tts overdose slc music "foreign_speech.wav"
```

**SLC with any-to-any translation (TranslateGemma 12B):**

```bash
# Translate to Arabic with original voice
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(auto-ar)" "foreign_speech.wav"

# Translate to Arabic with music preservation
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(auto-ar)" music "foreign_speech.wav"

# Shorthand: (ar) is equivalent to (auto-ar)
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(ar)" "foreign_speech.wav"

# Japanese to English
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(ja-en)" "japanese_speech.wav"

# English to French
python src/voder.py tts slc translate "(en-fr)" "english_speech.wav"
```

**SLC Parameter Reference:**

| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| `music` | No | Preserve non-vocals (extract and blend instrumental back) | Off |
| `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` | No | Any-to-any translation via TranslateGemma 12B (76 languages). `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` | Off (English-only via Whisper) |
| `overdose` | No | Additional STS v2 non-mimic pass for better voice fidelity | Off |
| `result` | No | Output destination | Auto-generated |

**Limitations:**
- Source language is auto-detected; output is **English** by default (use `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` for other target languages)
- Same-voice quality depends on how distinct the source voice features are
- Very short audio segments (< 3 seconds) may produce lower quality voice matching
- Heavy background noise reduces voice extraction accuracy

### SVC Sub-Task (Speaker Voice Change)

SVC (Speaker Voice Change) is a TTS oneline sub-task that transcribes single-speaker audio and re-synthesizes it with a **target voice**, keeping the original language intact. Unlike SLC (which translates to English), SVC only changes **who** is speaking — the words and language remain the same.

**Command Format:**
```bash
python src/voder.py tts [overdose] svc "source_path" target "voice_ref"
```

**How It Works:**
1. **Source Input**: Accepts audio files (single-speaker source)
2. **SVS Voice Isolation**: BS-RoFormer isolates the voice from the source (handles mixed audio)
3. **Transcription**: Whisper turbo transcribes the isolated voice in the original language (no translation; VibeVoice ASR is used when `overdose` is specified)
4. **Re-Synthesis with Target Voice**: Qwen3-TTS Base synthesizes the transcribed text using the target voice reference
5. **Optional STS Pass** (if `sts:` prefix on target): An additional Seed‑VC v2 non‑mimic pass is applied after Qwen‑TTS synthesis for enhanced voice fidelity to the target reference

**Command Catalog:**

```bash
# Basic SVC — change voice in source audio to target voice
python src/voder.py tts svc "source_audio.wav" target "target_voice.wav"

# SVC with overdose — enhanced processing
python src/voder.py tts overdose svc "source_audio.wav" target "target_voice.wav"

# SVC with sts: prefix — apply additional STS voice pass after synthesis
python src/voder.py tts svc "source_audio.wav" target "sts:target_voice.wav"

# SVC with voice description instead of file reference
python src/voder.py tts svc "source_audio.wav" voice "deep male narrator"

# SVC with multi-reference target (concatenated for richer voice extraction)
python src/voder.py tts svc "source_audio.wav" target "(ref1.wav)(ref2.wav)(ref3.wav)"

# SVC with STS pass and multi-reference
python src/voder.py tts svc "source_audio.wav" target "sts:(ref1.wav)(ref2.wav)"

# With output routing
python src/voder.py tts svc "podcast_clip.wav" target "new_speaker.wav" result "/output/changed_voice.wav"
```

**SVC Parameter Reference:**

| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| `target` | Yes* | Target voice reference file for voice change | — |
| `voice` | No* | Voice description for designed voice change | — |
| `overdose` | No | Enhanced processing pipeline | Off |
| `result` | No | Output destination | Auto-generated |

*Either `target` or `voice` required. Use `target` for voice cloning from a reference file, or `voice` for voice design from a description.

**Output Naming Conventions:**
- Default: `voder_tts_svc_*.wav`
- With STS pass: `voder_tts_svc_sts_*.wav`
- With `result`: uses the specified path

**Key Differences from SLC:**

| Aspect | SLC | SVC |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Language | Translates to English (default) or any language with `translate (source-target)` | Keeps original language |
| Purpose | Dubbing / language conversion | Voice swapping |
| Translation step | Whisper large-v3 translates | Whisper large-v3 transcribes only (or TranslateGemma 12B with `translate (source-target)`) |
| Target voice | Optional (defaults to source speaker) | Required |
| Music flag | Supported (`tts slc music`) | Not applicable |

### STS Voice Pass (`sts:` Prefix)

The `sts:` prefix can be applied to any `target` parameter value to request an **additional Seed-VC v2 non-mimic voice pass** after the initial Qwen-TTS cloning synthesis. This produces a more faithful voice match by running the TTS output through Seed-VC v2 using the `sts:` target as the reference audio.

**Where It Works:**

| Mode | Syntax | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Single TTS** | `target "sts:voice.wav"` | After Qwen-TTS cloning synthesis, Seed-VC v2 runs a non-mimic pass using `voice.wav` as reference |
| **Dialogue TTS** | `target "Alice: sts:alice.wav" "Bob: bob.wav"` | Per-character: Alice gets STS pass, Bob gets standard Qwen-TTS cloning |
| **TTS SVC** | `target "sts:target_voice.wav"` | After SVC re-synthesis, an additional Seed-VC v2 pass refines the voice match further |
| **Modify Speech** | Custom voice ref prefixed with `sts:` | After Qwen-TTS synthesis, Seed-VC v2 pass enhances voice fidelity |

**Examples:**

```bash
# Single TTS with STS voice pass
python src/voder.py tts script "Hello world" target "sts:narrator_ref.wav"

# Dialogue TTS — one character with STS pass, one without
python src/voder.py tts script "Alice: Hello" "Bob: Hi" target "Alice: sts:alice.wav" "Bob: bob.wav"

# SVC with STS pass for maximum voice fidelity
python src/voder.py tts svc "source_audio.wav" target "sts:target_voice.wav"

# Overdose SVC with STS pass
python src/voder.py tts overdose svc "source_audio.wav" target "sts:target_voice.wav"
```

**How It Works:**
1. **Qwen-TTS Cloning Synthesis**: The standard TTS pipeline runs first — Qwen3-TTS Base synthesizes text with the target voice characteristics extracted from the reference audio
2. **Seed-VC v2 Non-Mimic Pass**: The TTS output is then passed through Seed-VC v2 in non-mimic mode, using the `sts:` reference audio as the target. This additional pass refines the voice characteristics, producing a closer match to the reference voice
3. **Output**: The final audio has both the natural prosody of Qwen-TTS synthesis and the improved voice fidelity of the Seed-VC v2 conversion

> **When to use `sts:`**: Use it when standard Qwen-TTS voice cloning doesn't produce a close enough voice match. The additional Seed-VC v2 pass adds processing time but significantly improves voice similarity to the target reference.

### Dub Sub-Task (Video/Audio Dubbing)

TTS Dub is a sub‑task for dubbing video or audio content with voice cloning, optional translation, subtitle burning, and speed adjustment. It auto‑implies `overdose` and `extreme` (Fish S2 Pro). It defaults to auto→English translation (no `translate` keyword needed for English target). It transcribes speech with VibeVoice ASR, translates with TranslateGemma 12B (auto→English by default), generates per‑segment TTS with timeline‑based assembly (preserving audio events for non‑speech detection), re‑synthesizes with Fish S2 Pro using voice cloning from each speaker's original audio, adjusts speed to match original timing (threshold 1.5x/0.5x), mixes with instrumentals, and muxes with video.

**Canonical full-form command:**
```
python src/voder.py tts overdose extreme se dub subtitle "(auto-en)" translate "(auto-ja)" video "path"
```
Where `overdose` and `extreme` are auto‑implied by `dub` but recommended to include for clarity, `se` enables optional sound enhancement, `subtitle "(auto-en)"` burns subtitles with an independent translation to English, and `translate "(auto-ja)"` translates the dubbed audio to Japanese.

**How It Works:**

1. **Download/Extract**: If a URL is provided, the audio is downloaded by default (WAV output). Add the `video` keyword to download the full video (MP4 output). When `subtitle` is used with a URL, the video is downloaded automatically (subtitles require video frames). If a video file is provided, the audio track is extracted via FFmpeg
2. **SVS Voice + Music Separation**: BS‑RoFormer separates the source into voice and music stems
3. **Optional: SE Sound Enhancement** (`se` flag): UniSE enhances the voice stem before ASR for noisy input
4. **VibeVoice ASR**: Transcribes the voice stem with speaker diarization (overdose is implied). VibeVoice ASR and Fish S2 Pro are loaded separately to fit within 24GB VRAM
5. **Speaker Detection**: Each detected speaker's audio segments are extracted for voice cloning reference
6. **Audio Event Detection**: Non-speech segments are detected and preserved as audio events in the timeline
7. **TranslateGemma Translation**: TranslateGemma 12B loads once → translates dub segments (auto→English by default; `translate (source-target)` for other target languages) → (if `subtitle (source-target)` is specified) translates subtitle segments independently → unloads once
8. **Fish S2 Pro TTS (Per-Segment)**: Each speech segment is synthesized individually using Fish S2 Pro with voice cloning from that speaker's extracted audio reference. Segments are assembled on the original timeline
9. **Speed Adjustment**: Per‑speaker dubbed audio is speed‑adjusted to match original segment timing. Speed adjustment is applied only when the ratio exceeds 1.5x or falls below 0.5x; otherwise original pacing is preserved
10. **Mix with Instrumentals**: The dubbed voice is mixed with the extracted instrumental track
11. **Mux with Video** (video input only): The final audio is muxed with the original video via FFmpeg. If `subtitle` is specified (bare), VibeVoice ASR transcribes the dubbed audio to produce accurate subtitles — this is the final step after dubbing. If `subtitle original` is specified, subtitles are derived from the original audio processing chain (TTS text with original timing). With `subtitle (source-target)`, subtitles get an independent translation

**Command Catalog:**

```bash
# Basic dub (auto→English, voice cloning from source speakers)
python src/voder.py tts dub "video.mp4"

# Dub with subtitle burning (transcribes dubbed audio for accurate subtitles)
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "video.mp4"

# Dub with subtitles from original audio processing chain
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle original "video.mp4"

# Dub with translation to Arabic
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(auto-ar)" "video.mp4"

# Shorthand: (ar) is equivalent to (auto-ar)
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(ar)" "video.mp4"

# Dub with translation and subtitles (transcribes dubbed audio)
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(auto-ar)" subtitle "video.mp4"

# Dub with independent subtitle and audio translations
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "(auto-en)" translate "(auto-ja)" "video.mp4"

# Shorthand: (en) and (ja) equivalent to (auto-en) and (auto-ja)
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "(en)" translate "(ja)" "video.mp4"

# Dub with original-chain subtitles independently translated to English
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle original "(auto-en)" translate "(auto-ja)" "video.mp4"

# Full-form with all flags explicit
python src/voder.py tts overdose extreme se dub translate "(auto-ar)" subtitle "video.mp4"

# Dub audio file (output is WAV)
python src/voder.py tts dub "audio.wav"

# Dub with specific source-target translation
python src/voder.py tts dub translate "(ja-en)" "japanese_video.mp4"

# Dub from URL — audio downloaded by default → WAV output
python src/voder.py tts dub "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Dub from URL with `video` keyword — video downloaded → MP4 with dubbed audio muxed back
python src/voder.py tts dub video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Dub from URL with `subtitle` keyword — video is downloaded automatically (subtitles require frames)
python src/voder.py tts dub subtitle "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."
```

**Dub Parameter Reference:**

| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| `dub` | Yes | Invoke dub sub-task with input path (auto‑implies extreme/Fish S2 Pro) | — |
| `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` | No | Any-to-any translation via TranslateGemma 12B (76 languages). Overrides default auto→English. `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` | Off (auto→English) |
| `subtitle` | No | Transcribe dubbed audio with VibeVoice ASR and burn subtitles onto output video (final step after dubbing) | Off |
| `subtitle original` | No | Burn subtitles derived from the original audio processing chain (TTS text with original timing) | Off |
| `subtitle (source-target)` or `subtitle (target)` | No | Transcribe dubbed audio and burn independently translated subtitles (separate from dub audio language). `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` | Off |
| `subtitle original (source-target)` or `subtitle original (target)` | No | Burn subtitles from the original audio chain with independent translation. `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` | Off |
| `se` | No | Enable sound enhancement before ASR | Off |
| `video "path"` | No | Specify input video path | Auto from positional |
| `video` | No | (flag) When source is a URL, download the full video and output MP4 (default: audio download → WAV). Implicit when `subtitle` is used with a URL. | Off |
| `overdose` | No | Auto‑implied by dub, can be specified for clarity | On (implied) |
| `result "path"` | No | Custom output path | Auto-generated |

**Requirements:** 24GB+ VRAM (VibeVoice ASR and Fish S2 Pro loaded separately), FFmpeg

**Limitations:**
- Overlapping speakers are best‑effort: VibeVoice's overlap detection handles simultaneous speech, but dubbed quality may vary for heavily overlapping segments
- Multilingual input not supported: The source audio should be predominantly in one language for best results
- Translation quality depends on TranslateGemma's accuracy for the specific language pair

**Output:** MP4 for video file input, WAV for audio file input. URL input: WAV by default (audio downloaded), MP4 if `video` keyword or `subtitle` keyword is used (video downloaded).

### Interactive Modify-Speech (formerly STT+TTS)

In TTS interactive mode (via `python src/voder.py cli`), you can provide audio, video, or a URL and choose to **modify speech**. This replaces the old standalone STT+TTS mode. The flow is:

1. **Provide audio/video/URL input**
2. **SVS Isolation**: BS-RoFormer isolates the voice from the source
3. **Whisper Transcription**: The isolated voice is transcribed to text
4. **Edit Text**: You review and edit the transcription (fix errors, change words, modify content)
5. **Choose Voice**: Use the source speaker's voice or provide a custom voice reference. Custom references support `sts:` prefix for an additional Seed‑VC v2 pass, and multi‑reference format `(path1)(path2)(path3)` for richer voice extraction
6. **Qwen-TTS Synthesis**: The edited text is synthesized with the chosen voice
7. **Optional STS Pass**: If `sts:` prefix was used on the voice reference, an additional Seed‑VC v2 non‑mimic pass is applied after Qwen‑TTS synthesis

```bash
# Interactive mode
python src/voder.py cli
# Then select TTS from the menu
# When prompted "modify speech? (Y/N)", choose Y
# Provide audio/video/URL source
# Edit the transcribed text
# Choose voice (source or custom)
```

### Voice Stabilization

VoiceDesign characters in dialogue mode automatically get their voice stabilized. After 3 script lines, the outputs are concatenated, SVS-cleaned, and fed to Qwen3-TTS Base for voice extraction. All subsequent lines use the cloned voice instead of VoiceDesign, eliminating vocal drift in long dialogues. This happens automatically — no configuration is needed.

---

## 2.1a Voice Training (train voice / train extreme voice)

> `train` saves a voice clone as a `.tts` (standard Qwen3-TTS) or `.ttse` (extreme Fish S2-Pro) file in `voices/` for later reuse in TTS via the `voice "<name>"` parameter.

Train a voice clone from reference audio and save it for later reuse. Oneline-only command.

**Standard mode** (`train voice`) uses Qwen3-TTS Base and saves `.tts` files.
**Extreme mode** (`train extreme voice`) uses Fish Audio S2-Pro and saves `.ttse` files.

**Command Syntax:**

```bash
python src/voder.py train voice:character-name "path1" "path2" ...
python src/voder.py train extreme voice:character-name "path1" "path2" ...
```

- `character-name` is the name used to reference the trained voice later
- One or more audio file paths provide the reference audio for training
- Multiple paths are SVS-cleaned individually and concatenated into a composite before voice extraction
- Add the `first` keyword before the paths to extract only the first reference's speaker from all others via TSE: `train voice:name first "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav"` — the first reference identifies the target speaker, and TSE extraction pulls that speaker's voice from the remaining references before compiling
- The trained voice is saved as `voder_tts_character-name_timestamp.tts` (standard) or `voder_ttse_character-name_timestamp.ttse` (extreme) in the `voices/` directory

**Optional Test Sample:**

- Add `test` at the end to generate a test sample using a hardcoded 30+ second script:
  ```bash
  python src/voder.py train voice:my-character "ref1.wav" "ref2.wav" test
  ```

- Add `test "custom script"` to use a custom test script:
  ```bash
  python src/voder.py train voice:my-character "ref1.wav" test "Custom test script for verification"
  ```

**Examples:**

```bash
# Train from single reference
python src/voder.py train voice:narrator "narrator_ref.wav"

# Train from multiple references
python src/voder.py train voice:hero "hero_clip1.wav" "hero_clip2.wav" "hero_clip3.wav"

# Train with test sample
python src/voder.py train voice:narrator "ref.wav" test

# Train with custom test script
python src/voder.py train voice:narrator "ref.wav" test "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
```

### Voice Prompt Syntax

Voice prompts are natural language descriptions. The model extracts semantic meaning, so order doesn't matter:

```
"adult male, deep voice, authoritative tone, British accent, measured pace"
"young female, energetic, fast-paced, cheerful, American accent"
"elderly male, gravelly voice, slow and deliberate, storytelling quality"
```

**Effective Elements to Include:**
- **Age**: young adult, middle-aged, elderly
- **Gender**: male, female, androgynous
- **Tone**: warm, cold, friendly, authoritative, dramatic
- **Pace**: fast-paced, measured, slow, deliberate
- **Quality**: clear, gravelly, breathy, resonant
- **Accent**: British, American, Southern, neutral
- **Context**: professional, casual, broadcast, conversational

### Reference Audio Requirements (Voice Cloning)

| Factor | Requirement | Why |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| **Duration** | 10-30 seconds optimal | Enough data for voice extraction; longer doesn't help |
| **Quality** | Clear, minimal noise | Noise interferes with voice feature extraction |
| **Content** | Continuous speech | Silence or music doesn't contribute voice data |
| **Speaker** | Single speaker only | Mixed speakers confuse the extraction |
| **Format** | WAV preferred, MP3 supported | WAV preserves audio fidelity |

> **Pro Tip**: Run noisy reference audio through SE (Sound Enhancement) before using for voice cloning. VODER can also use BS-RoFormer to extract clean vocals from a mixed recording before cloning.

### Voice Consistency in Dialogue
VODER extracts voice characteristics **once per character** at the start of dialogue processing. This means:
- All lines from "James" use the same extracted voice profile
- No variation between the 1st and 10th line of the same character
- Professional-quality consistency throughout long dialogues

**Voice Stabilization:** VoiceDesign characters in dialogue mode automatically get their voice stabilized after 3 lines. The outputs are concatenated, SVS-cleaned, and fed to Qwen3-TTS Base for voice extraction. All subsequent lines use the cloned voice instead of VoiceDesign, eliminating vocal drift. This is automatic — no configuration needed.

## 2.2 STS (Speech-to-Speech Voice Conversion)

### What It Is
STS mode transforms the **voice** in source audio to sound like a different person, while preserving **everything else** — the words, emotion, timing, prosody, pauses, and delivery style. Only the speaker identity changes.

STS supports audio **and video** input/output. When given a video file, the audio track is extracted, processed, and optionally re-attached to the video.

### How It Works
1. **Source Separation**: BS-RoFormer extracts vocals and music from source audio; only vocals go to the VC model
2. **Target Extraction**: Clean vocals are extracted from the target reference
3. **Content Extraction**: Seed-VC extracts the linguistic and prosodic content from source vocals (what was said, how it was said)
4. **Voice Extraction**: The target voice reference is analyzed for speaker characteristics
5. **Voice Transfer**: The content is re-synthesized with the target voice characteristics
6. **Recombination**: Converted vocals are mixed back with the source music (unless `nomusic` is used)
7. **Output Assembly**: Audio is written (or re-attached to video container)
8. **Sample Rate Handling**: v2 model outputs at 22.05kHz (speech), v1 at 44.1kHz (music)

### Auto Vocal Extraction
VODER automatically runs BS‑RoFormer vocal isolation on both the source and target audio. For the source, vocals are separated so the VC model processes only the voice — producing cleaner conversion — and the instrumental is extracted separately for recombination after conversion (unless `nomusic` is used). For the target, clean vocals are extracted to improve cloning quality. If SVS extraction fails, the original audio is used as a fallback. This is particularly useful for:
- Converting vocals in mixed audio without degrading the music
- Cleaning up recordings before conversion
- Ensuring the VC model receives the cleanest possible voice input

### STS vs TTS: When to Use Which

| Scenario | Use STS When... | Use TTS When... |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Input | You have audio you want to preserve | You have text you want to speak |
| Delivery | You want to keep original emotion/timing | You want fresh synthesis |
| Content | Content is fixed (what was said) | You can edit the text |
| Source | Performance matters (acting, singing) | Text-only workflow |

### Command Catalog

```bash
# For songs/musical content - uses 44.1kHz model
python src/voder.py sts base "song.wav" target "singer_voice.wav" music

# Convert singing voice in a song
python src/voder.py sts base "original_song.wav" target "new_singer.wav" music result "/output/cover.wav"

# From video (music video voice conversion)
python src/voder.py sts base "music_video.mp4" target "new_singer.wav" music result "/output/cover.mp4"
```

#### Mimic (Style Transfer)
```bash
# Transfer voice timbre AND accent/emotion/style from target
python src/voder.py sts base "source.wav" target "character.wav" mimic

# This is invalid - mimic and music cannot be combined
python src/voder.py sts base "source.wav" target "reference.wav" mimic music
# Error: music and mimic cannot be used together
```

**Mimic Language Quality Note**: When using `mimic` for cross-language voice conversion (e.g., converting Spanish speech to an English speaker's voice), quality may vary. Mimic transfers timbre and style but does not translate content. For language conversion, use `tts slc` instead.

#### nomusic (Voice-Only Output)
```bash
# Output only the converted voice without mixing back source music
python src/voder.py sts base "song.wav" target "singer.wav" nomusic

# This is invalid - nomusic and music cannot be combined
python src/voder.py sts base "song.wav" target "singer.wav" nomusic music
# Error: nomusic cannot be used with music
```

#### original (Skip Source SVS Split)
```bash
# Skip SVS split on source — process full original source directly with SVS-cleaned target
python src/voder.py sts original base "source.wav" target "reference.wav"

# Original + mimic (process full source, mimic style and voice)
python src/voder.py sts original mimic base "source.wav" target "reference.wav"

# Original avoids SVS separation artifacts on the source, but background elements may affect conversion quality
```

#### extreme (Fish S2 Pro Reference Cleaning)
Pre-process the target voice reference through Fish S2 Pro before Seed-VC conversion. The extreme pass transcribes the compiled target reference with VibeVoice ASR, then synthesizes it with Fish S2 Pro using the transcription as `ref_text`. This produces a cleaner, more natural voice profile that extracts the dominant voice and removes background artifacts/noise from the reference, giving Seed-VC a cleaner input. Works with both Seed-VC v1 (music) and v2 (standard/mimic). Oneline mode only. If the extreme pass fails (empty transcription, encoding failure, or synthesis failure), the original target reference is used as fallback.

```bash
# Extreme pass: clean target reference with Fish S2 Pro before Seed-VC
python src/voder.py sts extreme base "source.wav" target "voice.wav"

# Extreme + music (Fish S2 Pro clean reference, then Seed-VC v1)
python src/voder.py sts extreme base "song.wav" target "singer.wav" music

# Extreme + mimic (Fish S2 Pro clean reference, then Seed-VC v2 style transfer)
python src/voder.py sts extreme base "source.wav" target "voice.wav" mimic

# Extreme + original (Fish S2 Pro clean reference, no SVS on source)
python src/voder.py sts extreme original base "source.wav" target "voice.wav"
```

#### Multi-Reference Target (Oneline Only)
```bash
# Multiple voice references concatenated for richer cloning
python src/voder.py sts base "source.wav" target "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"

# Multi-reference with MSTS
python src/voder.py sts base "song.wav" target "(singer1.wav)(singer2.wav)" music

# Multi-reference with first keyword (extract only first ref's speaker from all others via TSE)
python src/voder.py sts base "source.wav" target first "(voice1.wav)(voice2.wav)(voice3.wav)"
```

### Model Selection

| Flag | Model | Sample Rate | Use Case |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| (none) | Seed-VC v2 | 22.05kHz | Speech, podcasts, interviews (music auto-recombined) |
| `music` | Seed-VC v1 | 44.1kHz | Songs, musical content, singing |
| `nomusic` | Seed-VC v2 | 22.05kHz | Voice-only output (no music recombination) |
| `mimic` | Seed-VC v2 (AR+CFM) | 22.05kHz | Style transfer (voice + accent + delivery) |
| `extreme` | Fish S2 Pro + Seed-VC | varies | Pre-processes target reference through Fish S2 Pro for cleaner voice extraction, then Seed-VC (v1 or v2 depending on `music`/`mimic`) |

### Video I/O Support

| Input | Output | Behavior |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Audio (WAV, MP3, FLAC) | Audio (WAV) | Standard processing |
| Video (MP4, MKV, AVI) | Audio (WAV) | Audio extracted, processed, output as audio |
| Video (MP4, MKV, AVI) | Video (MP4) | Audio extracted, processed, re-attached to original video |

> **Tip**: The output format (audio vs video) is determined by the `result` file extension. Use `.wav` for audio-only, `.mp4` for video output.

## 2.3 TTM (Text-to-Music Generation with Optional Voice Cloning)

### What It Is
TTM mode generates **complete musical compositions** from lyrics and style descriptions using the ACE-Step model family. The model creates both the instrumental arrangement AND the vocal performance. You provide lyrics, describe the musical style, specify duration, and receive a fully produced song.

With the `vc` flag and `clone` parameter, TTM also supports **voice cloning** — generating music where the vocalist sounds like a specific real person.

> **Note**: The old `ttm+vc` command is no longer accepted. Use `ttm vc` with `clone "path"` for voice clone source. The `target` parameter is reserved for optional music references (`target voice "path"` / `target music "path"`).

### How It Works
1. **Lyrics Processing**: Lyrics are parsed into vocal melody and rhythm
2. **Style Interpretation**: Style prompt guides instrumentation, genre, mood, tempo
3. **Music Generation**: ACE-Step model creates aligned instrumental and vocal tracks
4. **Duration Matching**: Output is stretched/compressed to hit target duration
5. **Optional Voice Conversion** (with `vc` flag): ACE-Step is offloaded from memory, Seed-VC converts the vocal track to match reference voice, converted vocals are mixed back with instrumental

### Three-Tier ACE-Step System

TTM mode automatically selects the best ACE-Step model based on the task and flags:

| Tier | Model | Quality | Speed | When Used |
|------|-------|---------|-------|-----------|
| **Turbo** | ACE-Step XL-Turbo | Highest | Slowest | `overdose` flag — maximum quality generation |
| **Base** | ACE-Step XL-Base | High | Medium | `complete`, `extract`, `lego` sub-tasks |
| **Legacy** | ACE-Step 1.5 | Standard | Fastest | Default (no `task` specified), background music in dialogue |

### Sub-Tasks

TTM supports multiple sub-tasks via the `task` parameter:

| Sub-Task | CLI Keyword | Description | Model |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------|
| **Complete** | `complete` | Add missing tracks to existing audio; supports optional `styling` prompt, `noblend` flag, `voice`/`music` isolation, `usrc` blend source, and `sfx:` overlay specs | XL-Base (+ SVS if voice/music + TangoFlux for SFX) |
| **Lego** | `lego` | Build/generate individual instrument tracks; supports optional `styling` prompt | XL-Base |
| **Extract** | `extract` | Extract individual tracks from audio | XL-Base |
| **Remix** | `remix` | Style transfer (cover) with bias control; supports `voice`/`music` source isolation per entry (up to 3 sources), optional `lyrics` for new vocal content, and `reference` for additional guidance (up to 3 references composed into 30s composite) | XL-Turbo (overdose) or Legacy (+ SVS if voice/music) |
| **Repaint** | `repaint` | Restyle a specific time range of a song; supports `reference` for additional guidance; optional `voice`/`music` prefix on source for SVS isolation; multi-pass mode for sequential edits building on each previous result | XL-Turbo (overdose) or Legacy (+ SVS if voice/music prefix) |
| **BGM** | `bgm` | Replace background music in existing audio/video; strips music, generates new bgm, mixes at level; supports `video` flag, `reference`, and `sfx:` overlay specs | 1.5 Turbo (standard) or XL-Turbo (overdose) (+ TangoFlux for SFX) |
| **Overdose** | (flag) | Maximum quality full generation | XL-Turbo |

### 12 Instrument Tracks

The 12 available tracks are used by `lego`, `extract`, and `complete` sub-tasks:

| Track | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `drums` | Drums | Drum kit, percussion backbone |
| `bass` | Bass | Bass guitar, synth bass, upright bass |
| `guitar` | Guitar | Electric guitar (lead/rhythm) |
| `keyboard` | Keyboard | Piano, organ, synthesizer keys |
| `strings` | Strings | Violin, cello, string ensemble |
| `brass` | Brass | Trumpet, trombone, horn section |
| `woodwinds` | Woodwinds | Flute, clarinet, saxophone |
| `synth` | Synthesizer | Synth leads, pads, arpeggios |
| `percussion` | Percussion | Hand percussion, shakers, congas |
| `fx` | FX / Sound Design | Sound effects, textures, atmospheric elements |
| `vocals` | Vocals | Lead vocal track |
| `backing_vocals` | Backing Vocals | Background vocals, harmonies |

**Shortcuts**:
- `everything` = all 12 tracks
- `instruments` = first 10 (drums through fx, non-voice)
- `voices` = `vocals` + `backing_vocals`

### Unique Capability: Instrumental-Only
Using `"..."` as lyrics generates **purely instrumental music** with no vocals. This is how background music for dialogue is created internally.

### Command Catalog

#### Standard Song Generation
```bash
# With lyrics (song with vocals) — uses ACE-Step 1.5 (legacy, fast)
python src/voder.py ttm lyrics "Verse 1:\nLyrics here\n\nChorus:\nChorus lyrics" styling "pop, upbeat, female vocals" duration 60

python src/voder.py ttm overdose bgm "video.mp4" music "cinematic orchestral" level 50

# Replace background music with reference for style guidance
python src/voder.py ttm bgm "podcast.wav" music "upbeat electronic" level 35 reference "style_ref.wav"

# From YouTube URL with audio-only output
python src/voder.py ttm bgm "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." music "ambient chill" level 25 result "/output/new_bgm.wav"

# BGM with SFX overlay only (no music, SFX overlaid on clean voice)
python src/voder.py ttm bgm "voiceover.wav" sfx:"ocean waves/30-0/30" sfx:"seagull call/5-15/50" result "/output/ambient.wav"

# BGM with music, reference, and SFX
python src/voder.py ttm bgm "interview.wav" music "lo-fi beats" level 25 reference "ref.wav" sfx:"keyboard typing/10-30/20" result "/output/full.wav"
```

**BGM Pipeline:** Source → SVS voice pipe (strip existing music) → detect duration → [ACE-Step generate new bgm in 250-300s chunks if music provided] → [optional SVS music pipe on reference] → mix at level → [TangoFlux generate SFX → overlay SFX at position/level] → re-mux to video if needed

**BGM Output Naming:** `voder_ttm_bgm_{original-name}_{timestamp}.wav` (audio) or `.mp4` (video)

**BGM Key Rules:**
- `bgm` cannot be combined with `vc`, `remix`, `repaint`, `complete`, `lego`, or `extract`
- Source supports audio, video, and URL inputs
- `video` flag: when source is a YouTube URL, downloads the video file (not just audio) and merges the result back into .mp4. For local video files, video output is automatic (no flag needed). If `video` is used with an audio source, outputs .wav with a warning.
- Reference supports audio files, video files, and URLs — always processed through SVS music pipe for clean instrumental
- Normal uses ACE-Step turbo 1.5; overdose uses ACE-Step XL 1.5 turbo
- Default volume level is 35
- `music` is required unless `sfx:` specs are provided; if only `sfx:` specs are present, SFX is overlaid directly on the clean voice track (no BGM generation)
- `sfx:` overlay specs are overlaid after BGM mixing (or directly on clean voice if no music); SFX generated by TangoFlux with ACE-Step offloaded first
- Multiple `sfx:` specs are allowed; each generates and overlays an independent sound effect

### SFX Overlay Spec Format

SFX overlay specs allow sound effects to be overlaid onto the output of `bgm` and `complete` sub-tasks. Each spec follows the format:

```
sfx:"prompt/duration-position/level"
```

| Component | Required | Description | Validation |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `prompt` | Yes | SFX description text (e.g., "thunder rumble", "doorbell") | Must be non-empty |
| `duration` | Yes | SFX length in seconds (5-30) | Auto-clamped: <5 -> 5, >30 -> 30 with warning; minus sign stripped; invalid -> error |
| `position` | Yes | Place SFX at N seconds into source | Non-negative; cannot exceed source duration; invalid -> error |
| `level` | No | Volume 1-100% | Default: 50; minus sign stripped; <1 -> warning -> 1; >100 -> warning -> 100; invalid -> error |

**Parsing rules:**
- The spec is split by `/` into components: `prompt/duration-position/level`
- `duration` and `position` are separated by `-` (dash) in the second component
- `level` is the optional third component
- Multiple `sfx:` specs can be specified independently

**Examples:**
```
sfx:"thunder rumble/10-5/70"        # 10s thunder at 5s in, volume 70%
sfx:"doorbell/5-30"                # 5s doorbell at 30s in, volume 50% (default)
sfx:"rain patter/30-0/25"          # 30s rain at start, volume 25%
sfx:"ocean waves/30-0/30"          # 30s ocean at start (clamped from 60 -> 30 with warning)
sfx:"click/5-10/150"               # 5s click at 10s, volume 100% (clamped from 150 with warning)
```

**Behavior by sub-task:**
- **BGM**: SFX is overlaid after BGM mixing (or directly on clean voice if no `music` provided); `music` becomes optional when `sfx:` specs are present; ACE-Step is offloaded before TangoFlux loads
- **Complete**: SFX is overlaid after the blend step; `add` becomes optional when `sfx:` specs are present; `sfx:` cannot be used with `noblend`; if only `sfx:` (no `add`), the music model (ACE-Step) is not loaded; ACE-Step is offloaded before TangoFlux loads

**Model handling:** SFX is generated by the TangoFlux model. When SFX overlay is triggered, ACE-Step is offloaded from memory before TangoFlux loads, ensuring efficient memory usage.

### Lyrics Format

ACE-Step uses structural tags in `[brackets]` to mark song sections. Text inside brackets is not sung — it tells the model the song structure. Plain text between tags is the sung lyrics.

**Structural tags:**

| Tag | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| `[Verse]` / `[Verse 1]` / `[Verse 2]` | Verse section |
| `[Chorus]` / `[Final Chorus]` | Chorus section |
| `[Pre-Chorus]` | Build-up before chorus |
| `[Bridge]` | Contrasting section between verses |
| `[Intro]` / `[Intro: description]` | Song opening |
| `[Outro]` | Song ending |
| `[Interlude]` | Instrumental break |
| `[Instrumental]` / `[inst]` | Entirely instrumental (no vocals) |
| `[Hook]` / `[Solo]` / `[Break]` | Other structural markers |

**Special lyrics values:**

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `...` (three dots) | Empty lyrics — instrumental music only |
| `(text in parens)` | Context/style hint, not sung |
| `[text in brackets]` | Structural tag, not sung |

```
[Verse 1]
First line of verse
Second line of verse

[Chorus]
Chorus lyrics here
More chorus lyrics

[Verse 2]
Second verse content

[Bridge]
Bridge section lyrics

[Outro]
Final lines
```

### Style Prompt Guidelines

| Element | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| **Genre** | pop, rock, electronic, jazz, classical, hip-hop, folk |
| **Mood** | upbeat, melancholic, dramatic, peaceful, energetic |
| **Instrumentation** | piano and strings, heavy guitars, synthesizer, acoustic guitar |
| **Tempo** | slow ballad, mid-tempo, fast-paced |
| **Vocals** | female vocals, male vocals, choir, no vocals |

### Duration Considerations

| Duration | Best For | Quality |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 10-30s | Jingles, transitions, intros | Very consistent |
| 30-60s | Verses, choruses | Consistent |
| 60-120s | Complete short songs | Generally consistent |
| 120-300s | Full compositions | May have variation |

### Memory Optimization (Voice Clone Path)
The automatic model offloading between ACE-Step and Seed-VC stages means voice clone mode uses **less peak memory** than running TTM and STS separately.

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `lyrics` | Yes* | Song lyrics or `"..."` for instrumental; also optional for `remix` to guide new vocal content | — |
| `styling` | Yes** | Musical style description (optional for `complete`/`lego` sub-tasks) | — |
| `duration` | Yes** | Target duration in seconds | — |
| `clone` | No* | Voice clone source path (required when `vc` is set). Multi-reference format: `(path1)(path2)` concatenates multiple references into one. Add `first` keyword (`clone first "(path1)(path2)"`) to extract only the first reference's speaker from all others via TSE before compiling | — |
| `target` | No | Music reference audio (optional, with type prefix: `target voice "path"` or `target music "path"`; supports stem spec: `target "drums/(ref.wav)"`) | — |
| `remix` | No | Source audio for remix style transfer | — |
| `repaint` | No | Source audio for section repaint; optional `voice`/`music` prefix for SVS isolation | — |
| `time:start-end` | No† | Time range (for repaint, single-pass mode required) | — |
| `"start-end/styling(...)/..."` | No | Multi-pass repaint spec (quoted): time range required; optional `/styling(text)`, `/lyrics(text)`, `/reference-voice(path)`, `/reference-music(path)`, `/reference(path)` (up to 3 per pass), `/bias/nn`. Multiple pass specs = multiple sequential repaint passes. | — |
| `bias` | No | Cover strength 0-100 (for remix/repaint) | 40 |
| `reference` | No | Reference audio for remix/repaint/bgm guidance (up to 3 entries with `voice`/`music` prefix; `reference voice "path"`, `reference music "path"`, or `reference "path"` for as-is; multiple refs composed into 30s composite; supports stem spec `stem/(path)` and time spec) | — |

*`clone` required when `vc` is set. `target` is optional music reference only.
**Required for generation tasks (default, overdose).
***`add` is required for `complete` unless `sfx:` specs are provided. If only `sfx:` is used (no `add`), ACE-Step is not loaded.
†Required when using `repaint` sub-task in single-pass mode (not needed for multi-pass mode where time range is embedded in pass specs).

### Reference Time Spec

The `reference` path value can include an optional time spec to select a specific portion of the reference audio instead of using the entire file. This applies to all TTM sub-tasks that accept references (remix, repaint, complete, lego, bgm).

| Format | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `nn(path)` | `"50(ref.wav)"` | Start at nn seconds, extract up to slot max |
| `nn-nn(path)` | `"20-30(ref.wav)"` | Use specified range; slides to reach slot max if shorter |
| `nn-nn/nn-nn/nn-nn(path)` | `"20-30/40-50(ref.wav)"` | Multiple ranges from same audio, combined to reach slot max |
| `stem/(path)` | `"drums/(ref.wav)"` | Extract a single stem from the reference audio via ACE-Step |
| `stem-stem/(path)` | `"bass-drums/(ref.wav)"` | Extract multiple stems and mix them together |
| `stem/nn-nn(path)` | `"drums/20-30(ref.wav)"` | Extract stem then cut to time range |

The time spec and stem spec are both optional -- the old format `reference "ref.wav"` still works and uses the entire audio.

**Stem extraction** uses the ACE-Step XL-Base model to extract specific instrument tracks from the reference audio. The 12 available stems are: `woodwinds`, `brass`, `fx`, `synth`, `strings`, `percussion`, `keyboard`, `guitar`, `bass`, `drums`, `backing_vocals`, `vocals`. Multiple stems joined by `-` are extracted individually then mixed together. Stem extraction runs after SVS (voice/music) and before time-range cutting.

**Stem validation:** With `voice` prefix, only vocal stems (`vocals`, `backing_vocals`) are valid. With `music` prefix, only instrument stems are valid. As-is (no prefix) accepts all 12 stems. The `everything` keyword is rejected in references. Unrecognized stems are removed with a warning; valid stems proceed.

**Slot max by reference count:** 1 reference = 30s, 2 references = 15s each, 3 references = 10s each.

**Sliding logic:** If the specified range is shorter than the slot max, the start is slid back and/or the end is slid forward until the slot max duration is reached. If the audio is shorter than the slot max, segments loop to fill the slot. If the combined segments exceed the slot max, they are used as-is.

**With voice/music prefix:**

```bash
# Start at 50 seconds, extract up to 30s (1 ref slot max)
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "jazz" reference voice "50(ref.wav)"

# Use 20-30s range from first ref, 40-50s from second; each slides to 15s (2 ref slot max)
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "pop" reference "20-30(ref1.wav)" "40-50(ref2.wav)"

# Multiple ranges from same audio, combined to reach slot max
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "rock" reference music "20-30/40-50(ref.wav)"
```

**With stem extraction:**

```bash
# Extract drums from reference audio
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "rock" reference "drums/(ref.wav)"

# Extract bass and drums from music, then cut to 30-60s
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "funk" reference music "bass-drums/30-60(ref.wav)"

# Extract keyboard from 20-30s of reference
python src/voder.py ttm remix "song.wav" styling "jazz" reference "keyboard/20-30(ref.wav)"
```

**In repaint multi-pass specs:**

```bash
# Time spec inside a repaint pass spec
python src/voder.py ttm repaint "song.wav" "20-80/styling(jazz)/reference-voice(30-60(vocals.wav))"
```

## 2.4 STT (Speech-to-Text Transcription)

### What It Is
STT mode converts audio, video, images, and URLs into text. It uses Whisper for transcription and can optionally translate to English, identify **who spoke when** using Pyannote speaker diarization, or use VibeVoice ASR for advanced transcription with native diarization. This is the only mode that produces **text output** as its primary output (SS also produces text as a secondary output).

### How It Works
1. **Input Processing**: Audio extracted from video; text extracted from images via OCR; URLs downloaded via yt-dlp
2. **Pre-Cleanup** (optional): BS-RoFormer can separate vocals from music/noise before transcription for cleaner results
3. **Transcription**: Whisper transcribes with word-level timestamps (or VibeVoice ASR with `overdose`)
4. **Translation** (optional): With `translate` flag, Whisper large-v3 translates non-English audio to English. With `translate (source-target)` syntax, TranslateGemma 12B performs any-to-any translation across 76 languages. Use `auto` for source language auto-detection (e.g., `translate "(auto-ar)"`). The bare `translate` flag is incompatible with `overdose`, but `translate (source-target)` is compatible with `overdose`.
5. **Optional Diarization**: Pyannote identifies speaker segments (or VibeVoice with `overdose`)
6. **Alignment**: Transcription and diarization are aligned using three-tier overlap matching
7. **Output**: Text file saved to results/ directory

### Input Flexibility

| Input Type | How It's Processed |
|------------|-------------------|
| Audio file (WAV, MP3, FLAC, etc.) | Direct transcription |
| Video file (MP4, MKV, AVI, etc.) | Audio track extracted, then transcribed |
| Image file (PNG, JPG, etc.) | Text extracted via EasyOCR |
| Platform URL (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter) | Audio downloaded via yt-dlp after two-step verification, then transcribed |

### Flags: translate and overdose

STT supports translation and overdose flags with nuanced compatibility:

| Flag | Model Used | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `translate` | Whisper large-v3 | Transcribes AND translates non-English audio to English text |
| `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` | TranslateGemma 12B | Any-to-any translation across 76 languages. Use `auto` for source auto-detection. `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)`. |
| `overdose` | VibeVoice ASR | Advanced transcription with native speaker diarization built-in |

**`translate` flag**: Uses Whisper large-v3 (not turbo) for maximum translation accuracy. The output is English text regardless of the source language. Useful for subtitling foreign content, translating meetings, or processing multilingual media.

**`translate (source-target)` syntax**: Uses TranslateGemma 12B for true any-to-any translation across 76 languages. The `source` and `target` are language codes (e.g., `ja` for Japanese, `ar` for Arabic, `en` for English). Use `auto` for source language auto-detection. A single language `(target)` is shorthand for `(auto-target)` — e.g., `translate "(ar)"` is equivalent to `translate "(auto-ar)"`. Examples: `translate "(auto-ar)"` auto-detects source and translates to Arabic, `translate "(ar)"` same shorthand, `translate "(ja-en)"` translates Japanese to English.

**`overdose` flag**: Uses VibeVoice ASR which provides superior transcription quality with **native speaker diarization** — no separate Pyannote step needed. Ideal for challenging audio (multiple speakers, overlapping speech, noisy environments). Note: `overdose` implies diarization; the `dialogue` flag is redundant and ignored when `overdose` is active.

**Compatibility Rules**:
- `overdose` and bare `translate` (without parentheses) are **mutually exclusive** — Whisper's built-in translation conflicts with VibeVoice ASR
- `overdose` and `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` are **compatible** — TranslateGemma decouples translation from ASR, running after VibeVoice completes
- `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` works with `subtitle` — produces translated subtitles burned onto the video

### Subtitle Flag

The `subtitle` keyword is an STT sub‑task that produces a subtitled video instead of a text file. It auto‑implies `overdose` (uses VibeVoice ASR for transcription), so `stt subtitle` and `stt overdose subtitle` are equivalent; the explicit form is recommended for clarity. It only accepts **video files and URLs** — audio, text, and image files are rejected with an error.

**Pipeline:** Download video (if URL) → Extract audio → SVS voice isolation → Optional `se` sound enhancement → VibeVoice ASR transcription → Burn ASS subtitles onto video → Output MP4.

**Overlap handling:** When VibeVoice detects overlapping speech (two speakers talking at the same time), the primary speaker's text appears on the first subtitle line (white), and the overlapping speaker's text appears on a second line directly beneath it in cyan, making it visually clear that a different speaker is talking simultaneously.

**Dynamic positioning:** Subtitles are scaled and positioned at the bottom of the frame proportionally to the video resolution. Font size, margins, outline, and shadow are all calculated relative to the video height, so the result looks consistent whether the video is 480p or 4K.

| Flag | Model Used | What It Does |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| `subtitle` | VibeVoice ASR + FFmpeg | Transcribes video speech and burns subtitles onto the video |

**Restrictions:**
- Cannot be used with bare `translate` (without parentheses); `translate (source-target)` IS compatible
- Only accepts video files (MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, FLV, WebM, etc.) and URLs
- Audio, text, and image files are rejected

### SVS Pre-Cleanup
For audio with significant background music or noise, STT can internally use BS-RoFormer (SVS mode) to extract clean vocals before transcription. This is triggered automatically when the audio is detected to have high noise/music content, or can be manually invoked by running SVS first:
```bash
# Manual pre-cleanup: separate vocals, then transcribe
python src/voder.py svs "noisy_recording.wav" stem voice result "/clean/vocals.wav"
python src/voder.py stt "/clean/vocals.wav" timestamp
```

### HF_TOKEN Requirement
Speaker diarization (`dialogue` flag) requires:
1. HuggingFace account
2. Token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
3. Accept conditions at https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1
4. Token in `HF_TOKEN.txt` file or `HF_TOKEN` environment variable

> **Note**: `overdose` flag uses VibeVoice ASR and does NOT require HF_TOKEN for diarization. Use `overdose` if you don't have a HF_TOKEN but still need speaker identification.

## 2.5 SE (Sound Enhancement)

### What It Is
SE mode improves audio quality through seven sub-modes, each targeting a different enhancement need:

| Sub-Mode | Purpose | Output | Model |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| **default** | Speech denoising / dereverberation | Clean audio at 16kHz | UniSE |
| **voice** | Vocal enhancement from mixed audio | Enhanced vocals at 16kHz (+ blended with music at 48kHz) | SVS + UniSE |
| **sr** | Audio super-resolution (upsampling) | Upsampled audio at 48kHz | AudioSR (basic) |
| **sr music** | Music super-resolution with vocal separation | Upsampled music at 48kHz (+ blended with UniSE voice at 48kHz) | SVS + AudioSR basic (+ UniSE) |
| **sr voice** | Voice super-resolution with speech model | Upsampled vocals at 48kHz (+ blended with music at 48kHz) | SVS + AudioSR speech |
| **sr voice music** | Full SR: speech on vocals + basic on music, auto-blended | Upsampled vocals + music at 48kHz | SVS + AudioSR speech + basic |

### Sub-Mode Details

**Default (Speech Denoising):**
Removes noise, reduces reverberation, and restores speech clarity. Designed specifically for **speech content** — not music. Uses UniSE to produce clean audio at 16kHz.

**Voice:**
Extracts vocals from mixed audio via SVS, enhances them with UniSE, then blends the cleaned vocals back with the original instrumental at 48kHz. Ideal for improving vocal clarity in music or mixed recordings while preserving the instrumental.

**SR (Super-Resolution):**
Upsamples audio to 48kHz using AudioSR basic model. Processes the whole input as-is for general audio super-resolution.

**SR Music:**
Separates the music stem via SVS, upsamples it with AudioSR to 48kHz, and blends it with UniSE-enhanced vocals at 48kHz. Produces a full-resolution enhanced track where both music and vocals benefit from upsampling and enhancement.

**SR Voice:**
Extracts vocals via SVS, upsamples them with AudioSR speech model (optimized for voice) to 48kHz. With blend, the upsampled vocals are combined with the original music at 48kHz.

**SR Voice Music:**
Extracts both vocals and music via SVS. Applies AudioSR speech model on vocals and AudioSR basic model on music, then auto-blends both at 48kHz. This provides the most comprehensive SR treatment — each stem uses its optimal model variant.

### How It Works

**Default Path:**
1. **Audio Analysis**: UniSE model separates speech from noise/reverb
2. **Noise Reduction**: Background noise is suppressed
3. **Dereverberation**: Room echo and reverb are reduced
4. **Restoration**: Speech frequencies are enhanced for clarity
5. **Output**: Clean audio at 16kHz sample rate

**Voice Path:**
1. **SVS Voice Extraction**: BS-RoFormer isolates vocals from the mix
2. **UniSE Enhancement**: UniSE denoises/de-reverbs the isolated vocals
3. **Blend**: Enhanced vocals (upsampled to 48kHz) are blended with the original instrumental
4. **Output**: Enhanced mixed audio at 48kHz

**SR Path:**
1. **AudioSR Upsampling**: AudioSR basic model upsamples the input to 48kHz
2. **Output**: Upsampled audio at 48kHz

**SR Music Path:**
1. **SVS Separation**: BS-RoFormer separates voice and music stems
2. **AudioSR Music Upsampling**: AudioSR basic model upsamples the music stem to 48kHz
3. **UniSE Voice Enhancement**: UniSE enhances the voice stem
4. **Blend**: Upsampled music and enhanced voice are blended at 48kHz
5. **Output**: Full-resolution enhanced track at 48kHz

**SR Voice Path:**
1. **SVS Voice Extraction**: BS-RoFormer isolates vocals from the mix
2. **AudioSR Speech Upsampling**: AudioSR speech model upsamples the vocals to 48kHz
3. **Optional Blend**: If blend is enabled, upsampled vocals are blended with original music at 48kHz
4. **Output**: Upsampled vocals (or blended track) at 48kHz

**SR Voice Music Path:**
1. **SVS Separation**: BS-RoFormer separates voice and music stems
2. **AudioSR Speech Upsampling**: AudioSR speech model upsamples the vocals to 48kHz
3. **AudioSR Basic Upsampling**: AudioSR basic model upsamples the music to 48kHz
4. **Auto-Blend**: Both upsampled stems are blended at 48kHz
5. **Output**: Fully upsampled track at 48kHz

### What It Does NOT Do
- Cannot recover severely corrupted audio
- Default mode not designed for music (will degrade musical content — use `voice` sub-mode instead)
- Cannot restore missing frequencies beyond what AudioSR can infer (SR sub-modes)
- SR sub-modes cannot create detail that was never in the original recording

### Command Catalog

```bash
# Default — basic speech enhancement
python src/voder.py se "noisy_audio.wav"

# Default — from video file (enhanced audio re-attached to video)

## 2.6 SFX (Sound Effects Generation)

### What It Is
SFX mode generates custom sound effects from text descriptions using TangoFlux. Any sound you can describe, you can generate — natural sounds, mechanical sounds, ambient environments, impacts, transitions, sci-fi effects.

### How It Works
1. **Text Encoding**: The sound description is encoded into a semantic representation
2. **Diffusion Process**: Audio is generated through iterative denoising
3. **Duration Control**: Output is trimmed/looped to match requested duration
4. **Quality Scaling**: More steps = higher quality but slower generation

### Command Catalog

```bash
# Basic sound effect
python src/voder.py sfx sound "thunder rumbling in the distance" duration 10

# With quality parameters
python src/voder.py sfx sound "rain on a tin roof" duration 15 steps 50 guide 3.5

# With output routing
python src/voder.py sfx sound "footsteps on gravel" duration 8 result "/output/footsteps.wav"

# Short transition sound
python src/voder.py sfx sound "swoosh transition" duration 2 steps 20 result "/sfx/swoosh.wav"

# Ambient environment
python src/voder.py sfx sound "busy coffee shop with clinking cups and muffled conversations" duration 30 result "/sfx/cafe.wav"
```

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Range | Default | Effect |
|-----------|-------|---------|--------|
| `sound` | any text | required | Description of the sound |
| `duration` | 1-30 | required | Length in seconds |
| `steps` | 1-100 | 30 | Higher = better quality, slower |
| `guide` | 1.0-10.0 | 4.5 | Higher = stricter adherence to prompt |
| `result` | path | optional | Output destination |

### Sound Prompt Tips

| Sound Type | Prompt Strategy |
|------------|-----------------|
| Natural | Include environment: "rain on metal roof in a forest" |
| Impacts | Specify intensity and reverb: "heavy punch impact with long reverb tail" |
| Ambient | Layer elements: "forest at night with crickets and distant owl" |
| Transitions | Describe movement: "whoosh from left to right" |
| Mechanical | Include rhythm: "old clock ticking steadily" |
| Sci-fi | Mix familiar and unfamiliar: "futuristic laser with digital distortion" |

## 2.7 SVS (Source/Track Vocal Separation)

### What It Is
SVS mode separates mixed audio into individual stems using BS-RoFormer Resurrection. The most common separation is **vocals vs instrumental**, but the model can also separate other track components. SVS is also used **internally** by other modes: STS (auto vocal extraction before voice conversion), STT (pre-cleanup before transcription), and TTS (voice clone cleanup to extract clean vocals from mixed reference audio).

### How It Works
1. **Input Processing**: Audio extracted from video if needed; URLs downloaded via yt-dlp
2. **Stem Separation**: BS-RoFormer Resurrection analyzes the audio spectrogram and separates it into requested stems
3. **Output**: Individual stem files saved (or merged based on request)

### Supported Stems

| Stem Value | Output | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `voice` | Vocal track | Isolated vocals, singing, speech |
| `music` | Instrumental track | Everything except vocals |
| `both` | Two files (sequential) | Extracts voice stem first, then music stem |

### URL Support
SVS can directly download and process audio from URLs on YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and X/Twitter. URLs are verified by the two-step detection (shape check + yt-dlp video verification) before downloading. By default, only audio is downloaded (WAV output). Add the `video` keyword to download the full video and produce MP4 output (one video per stem, with the separated stem muxed back into the original frames).

### Command Catalog

```bash
# Separate vocals from instrumental (outputs both stems)
python src/voder.py svs "mixed_audio.wav"

# Get only the vocal stem
python src/voder.py svs "mixed_audio.wav" stem voice

# Get only the instrumental stem
python src/voder.py svs "mixed_audio.wav" stem music

# Extract both stems sequentially (voice first, then music)
python src/voder.py svs "mixed_audio.wav" stem both

# From video file (audio auto-extracted)
python src/voder.py svs "music_video.mp4" stem voice result "/output/vocals.wav"

# From YouTube URL (audio downloaded by default → WAV output)
python src/voder.py svs "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# From YouTube with specific stem and output routing
python src/voder.py svs "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" stem music result "/output/instrumental.wav"

# From YouTube with `video` keyword — downloads full video → MP4 output (one per stem)
python src/voder.py svs "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID" stem voice video

# With output routing
python src/voder.py svs "song.wav" result "/output/separated/"

# Batch processing
python src/voder.py svs "song1.wav" "song2.mp3" "song3.flac" result "/output/stems/"
```

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `stem` | No | Which stem to extract: `voice`, `music` | Both stems |
| `result` | No | Output destination | Auto-generated |
| `video` | No | When source is a URL, download the full video (default: audio download). Output is MP4 with separated stem muxed back, one per stem. | Off |

### Internal Usage by Other Modes

| Mode | How SVS Is Used |
|------|-----------------|
| STS | Extracts vocals and music from source (vocals for conversion, music for recombination), and clean vocals from target |
| STT | Pre-cleanup: separates vocals for cleaner transcription of music-heavy audio |
| TTS | When `target` reference contains background noise/music, extracts clean voice. Multi-reference targets (`(path1)(path2)`) are individually cleaned then concatenated. SLC sub-task: isolates voice from source audio/video/URL before translation. SVC sub-task: isolates voice from source audio before re-synthesis |

### Best Use Cases
- Creating karaoke tracks (extract instrumental from songs)
- Isolating vocals for voice cloning reference
- Pre-cleaning audio before STT transcription
- Extracting acapella for remixing
- Podcast noise removal (separate speech from background)

## 2.8 SS (Speaker Separation)

### What It Is
SS mode takes multi-speaker audio and separates it into **individual audio files** — one per identified speaker, along with a full transcript. It uses VibeVoice ASR which provides **native speaker diarization** — identifying who spoke when and extracting each speaker's segments into separate files.

### How It Works
1. **Input Processing**: Audio extracted from video if needed; URLs downloaded via yt-dlp
2. **Speaker Identification**: VibeVoice ASR analyzes the audio and identifies distinct speakers
3. **Segment Extraction**: Each speaker's segments are extracted and concatenated into individual files
4. **Transcript Generation**: A full transcript with speaker labels and timestamps is generated
5. **Output**: Individual speaker audio files + combined transcript text file

### VibeVoice ASR Requirements

| Requirement | Details |
|------------|---------|
| **Model** | VibeVoice ASR (bundled with VODER) |
| **HF_TOKEN** | Not required (VibeVoice handles diarization natively) |
| **Audio Quality** | Clearer audio produces better separation |
| **Minimum Speakers** | 2 (single-speaker audio is returned as-is) |
| **Maximum Speakers** | No hard limit, but accuracy decreases beyond ~8 speakers |

### Fallback Behavior

If VibeVoice ASR fails or is unavailable, SS falls back to a two-step process:

1. **Pyannote** performs speaker diarization (identifies who spoke when)
2. **Audio segmentation** extracts each speaker's segments based on diarization timestamps

The fallback requires `HF_TOKEN` for Pyannote (see STT section for setup instructions). The fallback produces slightly lower quality segmentation because Pyannote only provides timestamps (not VibeVoice's enhanced speaker embeddings).

### Command Catalog

```bash
# Basic speaker separation
python src/voder.py ss "multi_speaker_audio.wav"

# From video file (audio auto-extracted)
python src/voder.py ss "panel_discussion.mp4" result "/output/speakers/"

# From YouTube URL
python src/voder.py ss "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"

# With output routing
python src/voder.py ss "podcast_episode.wav" result "/output/separated/"

# With timestamp flag (adds timestamps to transcript)
python src/voder.py ss "interview.wav" timestamp result "/output/interview/"

# Batch processing
python src/voder.py ss "ep1.wav" "ep2.wav" "ep3.wav" result "/output/all_episodes/"

# With overdose (VibeVoice ASR for higher quality)
python src/voder.py ss "meeting.wav" overdose
python src/voder.py ss "podcast.mp4" overdose result "/output/speakers/"
```

### Output Structure

When `result` is `/output/separated/`, SS creates:
```
/output/separated/
├── transcript.txt          # Full transcript with speaker labels
├── speaker_0.wav           # Speaker 0's audio segments concatenated
├── speaker_1.wav           # Speaker 1's audio segments concatenated
├── speaker_2.wav           # Speaker 2's audio segments concatenated
└── ...
```

The transcript format:
```
[00:00.000 → 00:05.200] Speaker 0: Welcome everyone to today's discussion.
[00:05.500 → 00:08.300] Speaker 1: Thank you for having me.
[00:09.000 → 00:15.100] Speaker 0: Let's start with the first topic.
[00:15.500 → 00:22.800] Speaker 2: I have some thoughts on that.
```

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Required | Purpose | Default |
|-----------|----------|---------|---------|
| `timestamp` | No | Include timestamps in transcript | Off (speaker labels only) |
| `result` | No | Output directory | Auto-generated |

### Best Use Cases
- Separating podcast guests for individual processing
- Extracting individual speaker audio for voice cloning references
- Pre-processing interviews before transcription
- Creating speaker-specific training data
- Analyzing multi-speaker recordings

## 2.9 Side-Quests (`quest`)

> `quest` performs small utility tasks (URL download, audio format conversion, cutting, merging, audio effects, etc.) that produce files for the main modes to consume.

### What It Is
Side-quests are lightweight utility tasks that live outside the voder engine. They are designed to grow over time as more quests are added. Each quest is a small class registered in a `SIDE_QUESTS` registry, so adding new quests does not require touching the dispatcher.

### Available Quests

| Quest | Purpose | Inputs accepted | Inputs refused | Output naming |
|-------|---------|-----------------|----------------|---------------|
| `download` | Fetch a URL as audio (default), video (`video` keyword), or image (`image` keyword via gallery-dl). Also copies local files. | URLs from any supported platform (YouTube, TikTok, Bilibili, Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, X/Twitter, Reddit) + experimental `public_net`. Local audio/video/image files. | Non-media URLs (file hosts, yandex-disk, DRM content) | `voder_quest_download_<name>_<timestamp>.<ext>` in `results/downloads/{audios,videos,images}/` |
| `noframes` | Extract audio from a local video file. | Local video files (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.mov`, `.avi`, `.webm`, `.flv`, `.wmv`, `.m4v`) | URLs, audio-only files | `voder_quest_noframes_<name>_<timestamp>.wav` in `results/` (PCM 16-bit 44.1 kHz stereo) |
| `mix` | Overlay multiple audio/video sources at specified start times into a single WAV. First source is the base (starts at 0s); subsequent sources can have an optional start time in seconds before them. | Local audio files, local video files (audio extracted), URLs from any supported platform | Non-number tokens between sources | `voder_quest_mix_<joined-names>_<timestamp>.wav` in `results/` |

> The full list of side-quests (17 in Media Manipulation plus standalone `download`) lives in [COMMAND_CATALOG.md](COMMAND_CATALOG.md) §9. The table above highlights the three most commonly used in a typical VODER workflow.

### How It Works
- Each quest subclasses `SideQuest` and implements `parse(args)` (validates arguments and returns `(parsed_dict, error_or_None)`) and `execute(parsed, results_dir, timestamp, result_path=None)` (does the work and returns `True`/`False`).
- A quest is registered with `_register_side_quest(QuestClass)`, which adds an instance to the global `SIDE_QUESTS` dict keyed by the quest's `name` attribute.
- `oneline_quest(params)` looks up the quest by name in `SIDE_QUESTS`, calls its `parse()`, then its `execute()`. Adding a new quest does not require any change to the dispatcher — just define the class and register it.

### Command Examples

```bash
# Download a YouTube URL as audio (default, MP3)
python src/voder.py quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Download the same URL as video (MP4)
python src/voder.py quest download video "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..."

# Download an image (or image gallery) from Reddit/Instagram/X via gallery-dl
python src/voder.py quest download image "https://reddit.com/r/.../comments/..."

# Copy a local file to results/downloads/ with the quest naming scheme
python src/voder.py quest download "/path/to/local.wav"

# Extract audio from a local MP4
python src/voder.py quest noframes "video.mp4"

# With result path
python src/voder.py quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." result "./out.mp3"
python src/voder.py quest download image "https://reddit.com/..." result "./out.jpg"
python src/voder.py quest noframes "video.mp4" result "./out.wav"
```

### Best Use Cases
- Fetching audio from a URL into `results/` without running any voder engine work
- Extracting audio from a local video file for downstream processing
- Serving as the first chain in a `chains` pipeline (e.g., `quest download` → `stt`)
- Standalone URL downloader / video-to-audio extractor for quick tasks

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Required | Description | Default |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `<quest-name>` | Yes | The quest to run (`download` or `noframes`) | — |
| `video` | No (`download` only) | Switch to video download instead of audio | Audio |
| `"<url>"` / `"<path>"` | Yes | URL or local file path | — |
| `result` | No | Copy the result to a custom path | Auto |

---

## 2.10 Chains (`chains`)

> `chains` composes the main voder oneline tasks (TTS, STS, TTM, STT, SE, SFX, SVS, SS) and the other features (`train`, `quest`) into user-defined pipelines whose intermediate outputs are kept in `temp_chains/`.

### What It Is
Chains are the user-defined pipeline layer of voder. Where voder's prebuilt modes (TTS, STT, SVS, etc.) define fixed workflows, chains let the user wire any number of voder oneline tasks together end-to-end. Each chain is named, runs a voder oneline command, and its output is captured to a temp directory. Later chains can reference earlier chain names as input paths — voder resolves them internally to the captured temp file.

### How It Works
- `ChainPipeline` is the class that orchestrates parsing, validation, substitution, and execution.
- `split_segments(args)` splits the argv on the literal `/` separator.
- `parse_chain_segment(seg)` extracts `(name, command_args)` from each segment.
- `validate(parsed_chains)` enforces duplicate-name detection and skips empty chains (their names remain available for reuse).
- `substitute_refs(command_args)` walks a later chain's args and replaces any chain-name reference with the indexed temp file path.
- `execute(chains_args, result_path=None)` runs the pipeline: snapshot `results/` and `voices/` before each chain, run the chain via `parse_and_execute_oneline`, then capture new files. Intermediate chain outputs are moved to `temp_chains/`; the last chain's output stays in place.

### Command Format
```
python src/voder.py chains "name1" <voder command...> / "name2" <voder command that references "name1"> / ... [result "<path>"]
```

- ` / ` (space, slash, space) separates chains. The slash must be its own argv element.
- Each chain starts with a name. Shell strips quotes from argv, so `"name1"` and `name1` are equivalent.
- The rest of the chain's args are a normal voder oneline command.
- The optional trailing `result "<path>"` copies the final chain's output to a custom path.

### Validation Rules
- **Duplicate chain names** (two non-empty chains with the same name) are an error and stop the pipeline.
- **Empty chains** (a name with no command following it) are **skipped**. Their names are NOT marked as used, so the same name can be reused later in the same `chains` command.
- **Trailing empty chains** are ignored.
- If **all** chains are empty, the pipeline returns an error ("no valid chains to execute").

### Command Examples

```bash
# Generate a song → isolate vocals → voice-convert them
python src/voder.py chains "song" ttm lyrics "la la la" styling "pop" 30 / "voice" svs voice "song" / "cover" sts base "voice" target "ref.wav"

# Isolate vocals → enhance → transcribe
python src/voder.py chains "vocals" svs voice "song.wav" / "enhanced" se voice "vocals" / "text" stt "enhanced" timestamp

# Train a voice from a chain's output, then use it to speak
python src/voder.py chains "vocal" svs voice "song.wav" / "trained" train voice:singer "vocal" / "spoken" tts script "Hello world" voice "singer"

# Download audio → transcribe it (chaining a side-quest into a voder task)
python src/voder.py chains "audio" quest download "https://youtube.com/watch?v=..." / "text" stt "audio" timestamp

# Numbers and arbitrary names work too
python src/voder.py chains "1" tts script "hi" voice "male" / "2" se "1" / "3" stt "2" timestamp

# Empty chains are skipped (names remain reusable) — this is valid:
python src/voder.py chains "skip1" / "skip2" / "real" tts script "hi" voice "male"

# Duplicate names are an error and stop the pipeline:
# python src/voder.py chains "a" tts script "one" / "a" tts script "two"   # ERROR

# Use result to copy the final chain's output to a specific path
python src/voder.py chains "vocal" svs voice "song.wav" / "enhanced" se voice "vocal" result "./final.wav"
```

### Best Use Cases
- **Song cover pipeline:** `ttm` → `svs voice` → `sts` with a target voice reference
- **Vocal cleanup pipeline:** `svs voice` → `se voice` → `stt`
- **Voice training pipeline:** `svs voice` → `train voice:name` → `tts` with trained voice
- **URL → transcript pipeline:** `quest download` → `stt`
- **Multi-stage TTS pipeline:** `tts` → `sts` with target voice

### Parameter Reference

| Parameter | Required | Description | Default |
|-----------|----------|-------------|---------|
| `"<name>"` | Yes (per chain) | The chain name (any string; matched exactly against later chains' args) | — |
| `<voder command...>` | Yes (per chain, except empty chains) | A normal voder oneline command | — |
| `/` | Yes (between chains) | Chain separator (must be its own argv element) | — |
| `result` | No | Copy the final chain's output to a custom path | Auto |

### Notes
- Chain names are matched exactly (case-sensitive) against command arguments. If a chain name happens to look like a file path or URL, it still wins — voder checks chain names first.
- For multi-output commands (e.g., `svs both`, `ss`, TTM with stems), only the **latest** file produced by the chain is exposed as the chain's output. If you need multiple outputs, run separate chains.
- The `train` command works inside chains: its `.tts` / `.ttse` file is the chain's output and is stored in `temp_chains/` for intermediate chains.
- Chain outputs that are audio files can be used as voice-cloning targets, SVS inputs, SE inputs, STS bases, STT inputs, TTM references, etc.
- Chain outputs that are video files (e.g., from `quest download video`) can be used anywhere a video input is accepted.

# SECTION 3: SCRIPT DIRECTIVES SYSTEM

## What Script Directives Are

Script directives are special commands embedded **inside dialogue lines** that control how that specific line is processed. They allow fine-grained control over timing, volume, and duration at the **per-line level**.

## Why They Exist

Without directives, all dialogue lines are:
- Concatenated sequentially (no gaps)
- At uniform volume (100%)
- With duration determined by text length

Directives break these constraints, enabling:
- **Overlapping audio** (multiple lines at same time position)
- **Volume variation** (background lines at lower volume)
- **SFX duration control** (sound effects have fixed duration)
- **Audio layering** (SFX playing under speech)

## Directive Reference

| Directive | Format | Purpose | Applies To |
|-----------|--------|---------|------------|
| `/time:nn` | `/time:5` | Position line at 5 seconds from start | All lines |
| `/time:nn-nn` | `/time:10-3` | Position at 10s, cut 3s from end | All lines |
| `/time:nn+nn` | `/time:5+2` | Position at 5s, cut 2s from start | All lines |
| `/time:nn-nn+nn` | `/time:10-3+2` | Position at 10s, cut 3s from end AND cut 2s from start | All lines |
| `/level:0-100` | `/level:75` | Volume percentage for this line | All lines |
| `/duration:1-30` | `/duration:10` | Duration in seconds | SFX lines (required) |

## How Time Positioning Works

```
Without /time:              With /time:
┌────────────────────┐      ┌────────────────────┐
│ Line 1 (plays now) │      │ Line 1 /time:0     │
│ Line 2 (after 1)   │      │ Line 2 /time:0     │ ← overlaps with Line 1
│ Line 3 (after 2)   │      │ Line 3 /time:5     │ ← starts at 5 seconds
└────────────────────┘      └────────────────────┘
   Sequential                  Controlled positioning
```

## Deep Dive: /time: Syntax and Cutting

The `/time:` directive uses a flexible syntax that combines three operations in any order:

### Syntax Breakdown

```
/time:<position>[-<cut_from_end>][+<cut_from_start>]
```

- **Position (plain number)**: When the line should start (in seconds from the beginning of the output)
- **-nn (minus prefix)**: Cut this many seconds from the END of the generated audio
- **+nn (plus prefix)**: Cut this many seconds from the START (beginning) of the generated audio

### Understanding Cut Direction

The cutting terminology can be confusing. Here's how to think about it:

- **`-nn` (cut from end)**: Removes audio from the tail. Think of it as "trim off the last N seconds"
- **`+nn` (cut from start)**: Removes audio from the head. Think of it as "skip the first N seconds"

### Visual Examples

```
Original generated audio (10 seconds total):
┌────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 0s        5s        10s            │
│ [=========AUDIO CONTENT=========]  │
└────────────────────────────────────┘

/time:5-3 (start at 5s, cut 3s from end):
              ┌──────────────┐
              │ 5s      7s   │  (plays 0s-7s of original, positioned at 5s in output)
              │ [=========]  │  (last 3 seconds removed)
              └──────────────┘

/time:5+2 (start at 5s, cut 2s from start):
              ┌──────────────────────┐
              │ 5s              13s  │
              │   [=============]    │  (first 2 seconds skipped, plays 2s-10s of original)
              └──────────────────────┘

/time:5-3+2 (start at 5s, cut 3s from end AND 2s from start):
              ┌────────────┐
              │ 5s     10s │
              │   [====]   │  (first 2s and last 3s removed, plays 2s-7s of original)
              └────────────┘
```

### Why Use Combined Cutting?

**Scenario 1: Remove intro/outro padding**
- Generated audio often has a slight intro breath or outro silence
- `/time:0-1+0.5` removes the half-second intro breath and 1-second outro tail

**Scenario 2: Tight dialogue timing**
- Two speakers' lines should slightly overlap for natural conversation flow
- Line 1: `"A: Hello there!" /time:0-0.5` (trim tail to make room)
- Line 2: `"B: Hi!" /time:1.5` (starts before Line 1 fully ends, creating overlap)

**Scenario 3: SFX that's too long**
- Generated SFX might be 10 seconds but you only need the middle section
- `"sfx: engine revving /duration:10 /time:0-2+1"` keeps seconds 1-8 (removes 1s intro, 2s outro)

### Practical Command Examples with Advanced Cutting

```bash
# Podcast intro: music fades in under host speech
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "sfx: upbeat podcast intro theme /duration:15 /level:40 /time:0-2" \
  "Host: Welcome back to the show! /time:2" \
  voice "Host: warm male voice"
# The SFX has its last 2 seconds trimmed so the transition feels cleaner

# Dialogue overlap for natural conversation
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "Alice: I was thinking about what you said... /time:0-0.8" \
  "Bob: And? /time:3.5" \
  "Alice: I think you're right. /time:4.5" \
  voice "Alice: female, thoughtful" "Bob: male, curious"
# Alice's first line is trimmed at the end, Bob's response starts before she fully finishes

# SFX with precise timing - remove intro breath and outro decay
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "sfx: thunder rumble /duration:8 /level:60 /time:5-2+1" \
  "Narrator: The storm was approaching. /time:0" \
  voice "Narrator: deep voice"
# Thunder starts at 5s mark, but we remove 1s intro and 2s outro, keeping the "meat" of the sound
```

## Command Examples

### Basic Time Positioning
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "Host: Welcome to the show! /time:0" \
  "sfx: intro music /duration:10 /level:40 /time:0" \
  "Host: Today we have a special guest. /time:10" \
  voice "Host: male broadcaster"
```

### Volume Control for Background Elements
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "Narrator: The scene opens on a quiet street. /level:100" \
  "sfx: distant traffic /duration:20 /level:20" \
  "Narrator: A car approaches slowly. /level:100" \
  "sfx: car engine /duration:5 /level:40" \
  voice "Narrator: deep male voice"
```

### Complex Layering
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "sfx: rain and thunder /duration:60 /level:30 /time:0" \
  "Character: What a terrible night... /time:5 /level:90" \
  "sfx: door creaking /duration:3 /level:50 /time:10" \
  "Character: Who's there? /time:13 /level:100" \
  voice "Character: nervous male voice" \
  music "tense atmospheric horror" level "25"
```

# SECTION 4: SFX LINES IN DIALOGUE

## What SFX Lines Are

SFX lines are a special type of dialogue line where the "character" is `sfx:` (case-insensitive). Instead of speech synthesis, VODER generates a sound effect matching the description.

## Why This Integration Matters

Before SFX lines, you had to:
1. Generate dialogue audio
2. Generate SFX audio separately
3. Use audio editing software to mix them
4. Manually align timing and adjust volumes

With SFX lines, everything happens in **one command** — VODER generates speech and SFX, positions them correctly, adjusts volumes, and produces the final mixed output.

## Syntax

```
"sfx: sound description /duration:nn /level:nn"
```

**Required:**
- Character must be `sfx:` (case-insensitive)
- `/duration:nn` must be present (1-30 seconds)

**Optional:**
- `/level:nn` for volume (0-100, default 100)
- `/time:nn` for positioning

## Command Examples

### Simple SFX Insertion
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "James: Hello, who's at the door?" \
  "sfx: door bell ringing /duration:3" \
  "Sarah: That must be the pizza!" \
  voice "James: male" "Sarah: female"
```

### SFX with Volume Control
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "Narrator: The forest was alive with sounds." \
  "sfx: birds chirping and rustling leaves /duration:15 /level:30" \
  "Narrator: But something else was watching." \
  voice "Narrator: deep male storytelling voice"
```

### SFX with Time Positioning (Layering)
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "sfx: ambient cafe noise /duration:60 /level:25 /time:0" \
  "Barista: What can I get you today? /time:5" \
  "Customer: I'll have a large coffee, please. /time:8" \
  "sfx: coffee machine grinding /duration:5 /level:40 /time:12" \
  "Barista: Coming right up! /time:18" \
  voice "Barista: cheerful female" "Customer: casual male"
```

# SECTION 5: CROSS-USE FEATURE

## What Cross-Use Is

Cross-use allows mixing **generated voices** (via `voice` parameter) and **cloned voices** (via `target` parameter) in the **same dialogue**. This works in TTS mode (which now includes voice cloning via `target`).

## Why This Matters

Before the TTS merge, cross-use required switching between TTS and TTS+VC modes. Now everything is in one mode:

- Some characters with designed voices (`voice`), others with cloned voices (`target`)
- Perfect for scenarios where you have reference audio for some speakers but not others
- Mix known voices with new character voices

## Rules

1. Each character must use EITHER `voice` OR `target`, not both
2. Character names must match between script and parameter
3. Case-insensitive matching (James = james = JAMES)

## Command Examples

### One Generated, One Cloned
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "James: Welcome to our podcast!" \
  "Sarah: Thanks for having me!" \
  voice "James: deep male voice, authoritative" \
  target "Sarah: /path/to/sarah_voice_reference.wav"
```

### TTS Voice Cloning Syntax (formerly TTS+VC, now merged into TTS)
```bash
# This now works in tts mode too — cross-use is the default behavior
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "James: Let me share my screen." \
  "Sarah: Go ahead, I'm ready." \
  target "James: /path/to/james_voice.wav" \
  voice "Sarah: bright female voice, enthusiastic"
```

### Three Characters: Mixed Approach
```bash
python src/voder.py tts script \
  "Host: Welcome to the debate!" \
  "Guest1: Thank you for having me." \
  "Guest2: Pleasure to be here." \
  voice "Host: professional broadcaster, neutral accent" \
  target "Guest1: /path/to/guest1.wav" "Guest2: /path/to/guest2.wav"
```

# SECTION 6: BACKGROUND MUSIC SYSTEM

## What Background Music Is

When using `music` parameter in dialogue mode, VODER automatically:
1. Generates all dialogue segments
2. Measures total dialogue duration
3. Creates music matching that exact duration
4. Mixes music at specified volume level
5. Outputs final file with `_m` suffix

## How It Works Internally

```
Dialogue Lines → Speech Synthesis → Concatenation → Duration Measurement
                                                          ↓
Music Description → ACE-Step 1.5 (lyrics: "...") → Duration-Matched Music
                                                          ↓
                                     Mix (Dialogue + Music at Level %)
                                                          ↓
                                          Final Output (_m suffix)
```

## Why Use Empty Lyrics

The `music` parameter internally uses `lyrics "..."` for ACE-Step, which tells the model to generate **instrumental-only music** with no vocals. This is specifically designed for background/ambient use. The legacy ACE-Step 1.5 model is used for background music generation because it is faster and sufficient for ambient/background quality.

## Level Parameter Syntax

| Format | Meaning | Use Case |

‡`voice` in SE activates the voice sub-mode. `music` in SE is used with `sr` for the SR Music sub-mode.

## Flag Exclusivity Rules

| Rule | Modes Affected | Details |
|------|---------------|---------|
| `overdose` XOR `translate` | STT | Bare `translate` (without parentheses) cannot be used with `overdose`; `translate (source-target)` IS compatible |
| `overdose` XOR `dialogue` | STT | `overdose` includes native diarization; `dialogue` is redundant |
| `mimic` XOR `music` | STS | Cannot transfer style and switch to music model simultaneously |
| `remix` XOR `vc` | TTM | Remix and voice cloning are mutually exclusive |
| `sfx:` XOR `noblend` | TTM (complete) | SFX overlay cannot be used with noblend; noblend outputs generated instruments only, incompatible with overlay |

## Planning Complex Workflows

### Workflow Memory Budget
When chaining operations, you don't need to sum all requirements — models are offloaded between operations. Plan for the **peak memory of the most demanding step**.

### Example: Podcast Production Pipeline
```
Step 1: STT (12GB peak) → offloaded
Step 2: TTS voice clone with music (23GB peak) → offloaded
Step 3: Done

Total memory needed: 23GB (not 35GB)
```

### Example: Song Cover Pipeline
```
Step 1: SE (11GB peak) → offloaded
Step 2: TTM + vc (26GB peak) → offloaded
Step 3: Done

Total memory needed: 26GB
```

### Example: Foreign Film Dubbing Pipeline
```
Step 1: SVS — extract vocals (14GB peak) → offloaded
Step 2: TTS slc — dub to English (14GB peak) → offloaded
Step 3: Done

Total memory needed: 14GB
```

### Example: Any-to-Any Dubbing Pipeline (TTS dub)
```
Step 1: SVS — extract voice + music (14GB peak) → offloaded
Step 1b: [Optional] SE — sound enhancement (6GB peak) → offloaded
Step 2: VibeVoice ASR — transcribe with diarization (14GB peak) → offloaded
Step 3: TranslateGemma 12B — translate dub segments (+ subtitle segments if subtitle original (source-target)) (24GB peak) → offloaded
Step 4: Fish S2 Pro — synthesize with voice cloning (10GB peak) → offloaded
Step 5: FFmpeg — speed adjustment + mux
Step 5b: [If subtitle bare] VibeVoice ASR — transcribe dubbed audio for subtitles (14GB peak) → offloaded
Step 5c: [If subtitle (source-target)] TranslateGemma 12B — translate subtitle segments (24GB peak) → offloaded
Step 6: FFmpeg — subtitle burn + final mux

Total memory needed: 24GB (peak at TranslateGemma)
Note: VibeVoice ASR and Fish S2 Pro are never loaded simultaneously
```

### Example: Multi-Speaker Analysis Pipeline
```
Step 1: SS — separate speakers (14GB peak) → offloaded
Step 2: SVS — clean each speaker (14GB peak per file) → offloaded
Step 3: STT — transcribe each (12GB peak per file) → offloaded
Step 4: Done

Total memory needed: 14GB
```

# SECTION 9: TROUBLESHOOTING

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Out of memory | Insufficient RAM/VRAM | Check requirements table; close other apps |
| FFmpeg not found | Missing system dependency | Install FFmpeg to PATH |
| Slow processing | CPU-only operation | Normal for CPU; GPU speeds up certain modes |
| Diarization fails | Missing/invalid HF_TOKEN | Set up HF_TOKEN.txt with valid token |
| YouTube download fails | Network/availability | Check video exists and is public |
| Poor voice cloning | Bad reference audio | Use 10-30s clear speech, single speaker; run SE first |
| SFX quality issues | Insufficient steps | Increase steps parameter |
| Music doesn't generate | Single mode used | music only works in dialogue mode |
| SFX line ignored | Missing /duration | Add /duration:nn directive |
| Cross-use conflict | Both voice and target for same character | Use one or the other per character |
| `overdose` + `translate` error | Mutually exclusive flags | Bare `translate` is incompatible with `overdose`; use `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` instead for any-to-any translation with overdose |
| TranslateGemma OOM | Insufficient VRAM for 12B model | Requires 24GB+ VRAM; ensure other models are offloaded first |
| Dub speed misalignment | Dubbed speech timing differs from original | Speed adjustment is best-effort; very different language lengths may cause drift |
| Dub overlapping speakers | Overlapping speech produces mixed quality | Overlapping speakers are best-effort; consider running SS first to pre-separate |
| SS fallback to Pyannote | VibeVoice unavailable | Install VibeVoice model; or set up HF_TOKEN for fallback |
| TTS slc poor voice match | Noisy source audio | Run SE or SVS on source before tts slc |
| TTS svc poor voice match | Weak target reference or noisy source | Use `sts:` prefix for additional Seed-VC v2 pass; ensure clear target reference |
| SVS incomplete separation | Very mixed audio | Try SE first to clean up, then SVS |
| TTM overdose too slow | XL-Turbo is resource-intensive | Use standard TTM (1.5) for faster results |
| Video output has no audio | FFmpeg muxing issue | Ensure FFmpeg is installed and in PATH |
| TTM lego missing stems | Invalid stem names | Use only the 12 supported instrument track names |

---

# SECTION 10: PRO TIPS

1. **Enhance before cloning**: Run SE on noisy reference audio before using for voice cloning
2. **Separate before cloning**: Run SVS to extract clean vocals from mixed reference audio
3. **Test with short samples**: Generate 5-10 second tests before full production
4. **Layer with time positioning**: Use `/time:0` for overlapping SFX and speech
5. **Fade background music**: Use level `"0:50-30:20"` for intro-to-content transitions
6. **Batch STT for efficiency**: Process multiple files in one command
7. **Auto-clone for testing**: Use same file for STT analysis and voice reference to test pipeline
8. **MSTS for songs**: Always use `music` flag when converting singing voice
9. **Instrumental TTM**: Use `lyrics "..."` for backing tracks
10. **Result routing**: Always use `result` for automated workflows
11. **Check memory first**: Ensure 23GB RAM for any workflow involving music; 30GB for overdose
12. **Use overdose for final output**: Generate with standard TTM for testing, switch to overdose for final production
13. **SS before STT for multi-speaker**: Run SS first to identify and separate speakers, then transcribe individually for cleaner results
14. **SVS before STS for mixed audio**: Auto vocal extraction in STS handles most cases, but manual SVS → STS gives more control
15. **TTS slc preserves speaker identity**: SLC always translates to English while keeping the original speaker's voice (`tts slc "source.wav"`). Use `music` flag to preserve background music too
16. **TTS is unified now**: Don't think in terms of TTS vs TTS+VC — just use `tts` with `voice` or `target` (or both via cross-use)
17. **TTM is unified now**: Don't think in terms of TTM vs TTM+VC — just use `ttm` with `vc` + `clone` when you need voice cloning
18. **Legos for custom arrangements**: Use `lego` with specific `make` stems to build custom instrumental arrangements
19. **Extract for remixing**: Use `extract` to pull individual stems from existing songs
20. **Remix for style transfer**: Use `remix` with `styling` and `bias` to create cover versions with adjustable style strength; add `lyrics` to guide new vocal content; use multi-source (up to 3) for creative composite sources and multi-reference (up to 3) for diverse style guidance
21. **Repaint for section editing**: Use `repaint` with `time:start-end` to restyle specific sections of a song; add `voice`/`music` prefix to isolate source components; use multi-pass mode (`"start-end/styling(...)/..."`) for sequential edits that build on each previous result
22. **Overdose XOR translate**: Bare `translate` (without parentheses) is incompatible with `overdose` in STT — use `translate (source-target)` or `translate (target)` instead for any-to-any translation with overdose quality
23. **translate (source-target) for any-to-any**: Use `translate "(auto-ar)"` to auto-detect source and translate to Arabic, `translate "(ar)"` as shorthand for the same, `translate "(ja-en)"` for Japanese-to-English, etc. TranslateGemma 12B supports 76 languages and is compatible with `overdose` and `subtitle`
24. **TTS overdose for cleaner cloning**: Use `overdose` flag with TTS when doing voice cloning from dialogue sources — the 2s/3s trim on extracted voice clips avoids cross-speaker contamination and produces cleaner reference audio
25. **TTS overdose + music for premium output**: Combining `overdose` with `music` in TTS gives you both superior voice clip extraction (VibeVoice ASR) and higher quality background music (ACE-Step XL Turbo)
26. **TTS svc for voice swapping**: Use `tts svc "source.wav" target "target.wav"` when you want to change who is speaking without changing the language or content. Unlike SLC, SVC keeps the original language intact
27. **sts: prefix for better voice fidelity**: When standard Qwen-TTS voice cloning doesn't produce a close enough match, prefix the target reference with `sts:` (e.g., `target "sts:ref.wav"`) to run an additional Seed-VC v2 non-mimic pass after synthesis
28. **TTS dub for video dubbing**: Use `tts dub "video.mp4"` for end-to-end video dubbing with voice cloning from source speakers (auto‑implies `overdose` and `extreme`). Add `translate "(auto-ar)"` for any-to-any translation, `subtitle` to burn subtitles matching the dubbed audio text, `subtitle "(auto-en)"` for independently translated subtitles, and `se` for sound enhancement on noisy input
